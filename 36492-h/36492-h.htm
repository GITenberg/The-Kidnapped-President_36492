<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>I suppose to every man, at some period in his
life, there comes some adventure upon which, in
after life, he is destined to look back with a feeling
that is very near akin to astonishment. Somebody
has said that adventures are to the adventurous.
In my case I must confess that I do not see
how the remark applies. I was certainly fourteen
years at sea, but in all that time, beyond
having once fallen overboard in Table Bay, and,
of course, the great business of which it is the
purpose of this book to tell you, I cannot remember
any circumstance that I could dignify
with the title of an adventure. The sailor's
calling in these times of giant steamships is so
vastly different from what it was in the old days
of sailing ships and long voyages that, with the
most ordinary luck, a man might work his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
up the ratlines from apprentice to skipper with
little less danger than would be met with in a
London merchant's office. Though I was not
aware of it, however, I was destined to have an
adventure, stirring enough to satisfy the most
daring, before my seafaring life came to an end.</p>

<p>How well I remember the day on which I
was appointed fourth officer of the ocean liner
<i>Pernambuco</i>, running from London to South
America. I should here remark that I held a
second officer's certificate, but I was, nevertheless,
glad enough to take what I could get, in the hope
of being able to work my way up to something
better. It was not a bad rise, when all was said
and done, to leave a ramshackle old tub of a tramp
for the comparatively luxurious life of a mail
boat; much jollier merely to run out to the
Argentine and back, instead of dodging at a
snail's pace from port to port all round the
world. Then again there was the question of
society. It was pleasanter in every respect to have
pretty girls to flirt with on deck, and to sit beside
one at meals, than to have no one to talk to
save a captain who was in an intoxicated state
five days out of seven, a grumpy old chief mate,
and a Scotch engineer, who could recite anything
Burns ever wrote, backwards or forwards, as you
might choose to ask him for it. When I had
been six months on board the <i>Pernambuco</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
I was made third officer; at the end of the year
I signed my name on the pay-sheet as second.
Eventually I got my Master's Certificate, and
became chief officer. Now everybody knows, or
ought to know, that the duties of chief officer on
board a big liner, and, for the matter of that, on
any other boat, are as onerous as they are varied.
In the first place, he is the chief executive officer
of the ship, and is held responsible, not only for
its appearance, but also for the proper working of
the crew. It is a position that requires consummate
tact. He must know when to see things
and when not to see them, must be able to please
the passengers, and yet protect the interests of
his owners, must, and this is not the least important
fact, be able to keep his men constantly
employed, yet not earn for himself the reputation
of being too hard a task-master. Finally,
he has to see that all the credit for what he
does is not appropriated by himself, but goes to
increase the <i>kudos</i> of his commanding officer. If
the latter is a gentleman, and can appreciate his
officers' endeavours at their real value, matters
will in all probability go smoothly; on the other
hand, however, if the captain is a bully, then
the chief officer is likely to wish himself elsewhere,
or at least that he was the holder of some
other rank. This was my case on my last and
most memorable voyage in the service of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
particular Company that every one knows, but
which, for various reasons, shall be nameless.</p>

<p>I had never met Captain Harveston until he
joined us in dock on the day previous to sailing,
but I had heard some scarcely complimentary
remarks about him from men who had sailed
with him. I must confess, therefore, that I was
prepared to dislike him. In appearance he was
as unlike a sailor as a man could well be, was a
great dandy in his dress, and evidently looked
upon himself as an undoubted lady-killer. So
far as I was concerned, he had hardly set foot on
the vessel before he commenced finding fault. A
ship in dock, before the passengers come aboard,
and while the thousand and one preparations are
being made for a voyage, is seldom an example
of tidiness. Surely a skipper, who had been at
sea for thirty years, must have realized this; for
some reason, however, best known to himself, it
pleased Captain Harveston to inaugurate our
acquaintance by telling me that he liked a "spic
and span ship," and that he judged his officers
by what he saw of their work.</p>

<p>"You shall have nothing to complain of as
soon as I get the workmen out, sir," I replied, a
bit nettled at being called over the coals upon
such a trumpery matter.</p>

<p>"I trust I shall not," he answered superciliously,
and then strutted down the bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to his own cabin, which was just abaft the
chart-room.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the Isle of Wight was scarcely
astern before the trouble began. Young Herberts,
our second officer, was the first to get a
wigging, and Harrison, the fourth, quickly
followed suit. I felt sure my time would not
be long in coming, and I was not wrong. On
the second day out, and during my watch below,
I was talking to the purser in his cabin, when
the fourth officer appeared to inform me that
the captain wished to see me on the promenade
deck. Thither I made my way, to find him
seated there with a number of lady passengers
round him.</p>

<p>"Surely he is not going to be nasty before
these ladies," I said to myself as I approached
him.</p>

<p>I discovered, however, that this was exactly
what he was going to do.</p>

<p>"Mr. Helmsworth," he began, "I am told
that you have refused the passengers the use of
the bull-board."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I have not," I replied. "I informed
one of the gentlemen who spoke to me about it
that I would have it brought up directly we were
clear of the Channel. As a rule we never produce
it until we're out of the Bay. I had
Captain Pomeroy's instructions to that effect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am captain of this vessel now," he returned.
"Please see that the board is brought on deck at
once. I must ask you for the future to do all that
lies in your power to promote the pleasure of the
passengers. It is a duty I have a right to expect
of my officers."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," I answered and walked
away.</p>

<p>From that day forward I saw that my service
under Captain Harveston was likely to be a
short one, and, indeed, by the time we reached
Buenos Ayres, I felt as if I could throw up my
appointment altogether. He was never satisfied,
never pleased, and did nothing but grumble and
find fault from morning until night.</p>

<p>After the usual fortnight's stay at the capital
of the Argentine, we commenced our homeward
voyage. Our first port of call was Rio, where
Harveston and the third officer came to loggerheads.
By this time the whole ship's company
had taken his measure, and I fancy he must have
known it. Being of a petty disposition, he attributed
this to me, and accordingly laid himself
out to make my life aboard as disagreeable as it
was possible for him to do. How bitterly I
regretted the loss of my old skipper, who had
been kindness and consideration itself, I must
leave you to imagine.</p>

<p>And now I must turn from a narration of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
own misfortunes during that miserable voyage to
give you a description of a man, whose personality
is destined to play such an important part
in my narrative. He joined us at Rio, and was
one of the last passengers to come aboard. He
was a Spaniard, and, as could be seen at a glance,
a well-bred one at that. He called himself Don
Guzman de Silvestre. He was very tall; I should
say some inches over six feet, with the darkest of
dark eyes and hair, aquiline features, and a small
pointed beard, that he had a habit of stroking
when thinking. Taken altogether, a more
romantic personality could scarcely be imagined,
and as he came up the gangway, I told myself
that he was the best figure of a man I had seen
for some considerable time. When he asked me
at what hour we should sail, I noticed that he
spoke English perfectly, and in a musical voice
that was very pleasant to listen to. Before we
had been many days at sea, he and I had had
several talks upon all sorts of subjects, considerably
to Captain Harveston's annoyance, for the
latter did not approve of his officers being on
anything like friendly terms with the passengers.
Having no desire to quarrel with my chief, I
endeavoured, as far as possible, to keep out of
his way, but for some reason this only had the
effect of incensing him more against me.</p>

<p>We were a full ship on the homeward voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and, as we generally did a lot of painting
between Barbadoes and Madeira, I found my
time pretty well taken up. It was in connection
with this painting that the climax came. We
had left the West Indies behind us, and at the
time were steering a straight course for Madeira.
The men, when the incident I am about to
describe happened, were at work on the port
rails of the promenade deck. One of them, who
had been outside the rail, climbed over, pot in
hand, to obey an order I had given him. At
the moment that he did so, the long Atlantic
swell caused the vessel to give a big roll, and
before he could save himself, he was flying across
the deck towards a chair in which a lady was
seated. They came into violent collision, with
the result that the pot of white paint was
deposited in her lap. I hastened to her
assistance, and did all that was possible at the
moment to remedy the mishap. Fortunately for
the man, who was overcome by the magnitude of
the catastrophe, she took the accident in excellent
part.</p>

<p>"You must not blame the man," she said to
me. "It was not his fault. I shall have to sue
the ocean for damages."</p>

<p>Then with a laugh she went below to change
her attire.</p>

<p>As ill luck would have it, just after she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
disappeared, the skipper emerged from the
companion, and saw the splashes of paint.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this, sir?" he asked,
turning on me angrily.</p>

<p>"One of the men met with an accident, sir," I
replied. "The roll of the ship caused him to
upset the paint-pot."</p>

<p>"You should not put that class of fellow to do
such work," he returned, oblivious to the fact
that he was committing the unpardonable sin of
admonishing an officer before the men. "You
seem to have no discrimination at all, Mr.
Helmsworth."</p>

<p>With that he walked away, leaving me to chew
my cud of humiliation in silence. After luncheon
I received an order to go to the captain's cabin.
I could see that I was in for more trouble, but
could not guess what. One thing was very
evident; he was in a towering rage.</p>

<p>"How is it, Mr. Helmsworth," he began, when
I had entered the cabin and had closed the door,
"that you deliberately kept things from me this
morning that it was your duty to tell me?"</p>

<p>"I am not aware that I have kept anything back
from you, sir," I replied, as civilly as I knew how,
for I had no desire to lose my temper. "If it
is with regard to the tiller of the port quarter
boat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has nothing whatever to do with the port<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
quarter boat," he answered savagely. "I want
to know how it was that you did not tell me
about that lady's dress being spoilt this morning.
You should have reported the matter to me.
Had it not been for my steward, I should have
known nothing whatsoever about it."</p>

<p>"I did not think it worth while to trouble you
with it, sir," I replied. "It was a pure accident,
and Miss Burgess forgave the man, and admitted
that he was not to blame."</p>

<p>"Accident or no accident," he retorted, "you
should have informed me of the circumstance.
I consider you sadly wanting in your duty, Mr.
Helmsworth. Of late, your manner has been
most disrespectful to me, and I tell you to your
face, sir, that your ship is a disgrace to any
chief officer."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you should say that," I answered,
endeavouring to keep my temper; "I have
always had the reputation of turning my ship
out well. If you will point out anything that
is wrong, I will at once have it rectified."</p>

<p>"Don't bandy words with me, sir," he stormed.
"I am not used to it from my officers. I repeat
that your ship is a disgrace to any chief officer,
and I shall take care that the matter is duly reported
to the Board as soon as we reach London."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be good enough to tell me
what you consider wrong, sir?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything," he answered. "I thought
yesterday I pointed out to you a hole in the
after awning."</p>

<p>"You did, sir, and it has been repaired. I put
the sail-maker on to it at once."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair with a look of triumph
on his face.</p>

<p>"Kindly step aft with me," he said, "and let
us examine it for ourselves."</p>

<p>Feeling confident that what I had said was
correct, I gladly accompanied him, but to my
horror, when we reached the place in question,
there was the rent gaping at us without a stitch
in it.</p>

<p>"I regret exceedingly that you should consider
it necessary to cover your negligence by
telling me what is not true," he said in a voice
so loud that some of the second-class passengers
could hear it.</p>

<p>This was more than I could swallow.</p>

<p>"I'll not be called a liar by you, Captain
Harveston, or by any man living," I retorted,
feeling that I would have given something to
have been able to have knocked him down. "If
you will send for the sail-maker, he will inform
you that I gave him orders to do it this morning.
It is no fault of mine that he has neglected his
duty."</p>

<p>"It is the fault of no one else, sir," returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the captain. "If you kept the men up to their
work, this would not have been left undone. I
shall be careful to enter this occurrence in the
log-book."</p>

<p>So saying he stalked majestically away, and I
went in search of the sail-maker. The man, it
appeared, had intended doing the work, but had
been called away to something else, and had
forgotten it. After that, I returned to my own
cabin, and sat down to think the matter over.
There could be no sort of doubt that I was in an
exceedingly unenviable position. I could quite
see that if Harveston reported me, the Board
would be likely to believe his version of the
story, and even if they did not consider me quite
as negligent as he was endeavouring to make me,
they would probably argue that I was not all I
might be, on the basis that there can be no smoke
without fire. Whatever else might be said, a
reputation for slovenliness and untruthfulness
would be scarcely likely to help me in my career.
From that day forward matters went from bad
to worse. It seemed impossible for me to do
right, however hard I might try. What was
more annoying, I began to feel that, not content
with disliking me himself, the captain was
endeavouring to set the passengers against me
also.</p>

<p>During the run across the Atlantic I had, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
have said, several long talks with Don Guzman
de Silvestre. The man interested me immensely.
What his profession was I could not ascertain,
but from numberless little remarks he let fall, I
gathered that he was the possessor of considerable
wealth. Certainly he had seen a variety of
strange life. Were it not that he narrated his
adventures with an air of truth that left no room
for doubt, it would have been impossible to have
believed him. He had seen fighting in Mexico,
in Nicaragua, in Brazil, and with Balmaceda in
Chili.</p>

<p>"I suppose in South America there will be
Revolutions until the end of Time," I remarked
one evening, as we sat talking together in my
cabin.</p>

<p>"I should say it is more than likely," he
answered, taking his cigar from his mouth and
holding it between his long, slim fingers. "If
you take specimens of all the most excitable
races in the world and graft them on stock even
more excitable than themselves, what can you
expect? In such countries Might must always
be Right, and the weakest will go to the wall."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care much about being President
in that description of place," I returned. "It's
a case of being in power and popular to-day,
unpopular and assassinated to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There is certainly a large amount of risk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
this," the Don replied meditatively. "And yet
men are always to be found desirous of taking
up the reins of government."</p>

<p>I could not help wondering whether he had
ever felt the ambition he spoke of.</p>

<p>"I remember meeting a man in Paris some
years ago," he continued after a few moments'
silence, "who was what one might call a world's
vagabond. He had been a soldier in French
Africa, a shearer in Australia, a miner at the
Cape, a stockbroker in New York, and several
other things. When I met him, he was, as
I have said, in Paris, and practically starving.
He could speak half the languages of the
world well enough to be thought a native, was
absolutely fearless; indeed, taken altogether
he was about as devil-may-care a sort of fellow
as I had ever met in my life. Three years later
he was Dictator of one of the South American
Republics we have been speaking of."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"At the end of six months another man came
upon the scene, won the favour of the Standing
Army, and began to make trouble for those in
power, with the result that my friend had to
vacate his office, also the country, at remarkably
short notice. Some day he will go back and
endeavour to unseat the individual who supplanted
him. The latter gained his place by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
treachery, but if he is not careful he will lose it
by something else."</p>

<p>"Your friend is a man who does not forget an
injury then?" I remarked, with a well-defined
suspicion that he was speaking of himself.</p>

<p>"I rather fancy he is," he replied. "At any
rate, I am quite certain he is not one who
forgives."</p>

<p>Then he changed the conversation by inquiring
how long I had been at sea, and what countries
I had visited. With some of them he professed
to be acquainted.</p>

<p>"It is rather impertinent of me to say so," he
said, looking round to see that there was no one
near the door, "but I am afraid you and your
captain are not on the best of terms."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that we are not," I answered,
and stopped there, for I had no desire to discuss
the matter with him.</p>

<p>"You hold a Master's Certificate, do you not?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative, and once more
he was silent.</p>

<p>"I suppose you would have no objection to
shipping as captain," he went on after a long
pause, "if the opportunity ever presented itself?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly I should not," I replied, with
a laugh. "I fear, however, it will be some time
before I shall have such an opportunity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"In this line, perhaps," he said, "but I
suppose, if you had an offer from another firm,
you would accept it?"</p>

<p>"I should feel very much inclined to do so," I
said, wondering at the same time what he was
driving at.</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "but I hope to be as soon as
I can afford it. So far as I can see, however,
that event, like the captainship, is a long way off.
The good old days when skippers made money
are past, and now-a-days, what with entertaining
and one thing and another, it's as much as a man
can do to make both ends meet. Sometimes I'm
afraid they don't meet at all. I wish some kind
friend would come along and offer me a comfortable
shore billet on anything like pay&mdash;it would
do him good to see me jump at it."</p>

<p>"That may come yet," he replied, and then
he rose and bade me good-night.</p>

<p>A few evenings later, and as we were approaching
the English Channel, he again spoke to me
on the subject. His persistent recurrence to it
gave me a feeling that there was something
behind it all. But what that something was I
had no sort of idea. I was destined to find
out, however, even sooner than I imagined.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Four days later we reached England, and one
of the most unpleasant voyages I have ever made
was at an end. Having seen everything right
on board, I left the ship. Captain Harveston
had not said good-bye to me, and for this
reason I did not consider it necessary that I
should go out of my way to be civil to him.
That the man intended doing me a mischief
I felt certain, but what form his enmity would
take I could only conjecture. The entry was in
the log-book, and some action would be taken of
it without a doubt.</p>

<p>From London I took the train to Salisbury,
intending to walk out to my home at Falstead,
one of the loveliest if not <i>the</i> loveliest of all the
Wiltshire villages with which I am acquainted.
It was delightful to think that in a few hours I
should see Molly, my pretty sweetheart, again,
and in her gentle company, and that of my dear
old mother (my father had been dead many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
years), endeavour to forget for a fortnight the
worries and troubles that had been my portion
during the past two months. Molly, I must tell
you, or Miss Mary Wharton, was a lady of much
importance at Falstead. She was an orphan,
and her father had been the Vicar of the hamlet
for nearly fifty years. When her parents died
she had received an offer of a home in London,
but she could not find it in her heart to leave
the place in which she had been born, so she
remained on in the capacity of village schoolmistress
and organist, loved by the children, consulted
by the mothers, and respected by every
one. My father had been the local medico, and
I had known Molly all my life. We had played
together as children, had received our first lessons
together, had fallen in love later, and were
engaged when I was twenty-three and she two
years my junior.</p>

<p>It was nearly four o'clock when I reached
Salisbury and started on my five miles' tramp to
the village. My luggage I left to be brought on
next day by the carrier, taking with me a small
hand-bag containing sufficient for my immediate
needs. I can remember the time when those
five miles had seemed to me the longest walking
in all the world; now, however, after so many
weeks of sea, the green lanes, varied with open
stretches of down, were beautiful beyond compare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Every turn of the road brought to light
some spot of interest. I crossed the old stone
bridge at the entrance to the village, and noted
the place where I had caught my first trout, and
further on, as I passed a certain stile, upon which
hundreds of initials had been carved, recalled the
fact that it was there I had fought Nathaniel
Burse, the village bully, and, unlike the heroes
of most romances, had received a sound drubbing
for my pains.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile from my mother's
cottage I overtook the worthy Vicar, who, as he
informed me, had been to pay a visit to a farm
on the Downs.</p>

<p>"Let me be the first to offer you a hearty
welcome home," he said. "You seem to have
been away for a shorter time than ever this
voyage."</p>

<p>"It has certainly not seemed so to me," I
answered, and with a considerable amount of
truth. "I am the more glad to be back. How
is the village?"</p>

<p>"By the village, I suppose you mean Miss
Wharton, do you not?" said the old fellow with
a chuckle. "She is wonderfully well, and I
fancy is looking forward to your return. Your
mother keeps well also, I saw her yesterday."</p>

<p>We walked on together until I could see ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of us the little ivy-covered house in which I had
been born. At the gate I bade the kindly old
gentleman good-bye and entered, to be received
on the threshold by Molly and my mother. For
the next few minutes I had to submit, and I will
leave you to imagine whether I did so willingly or
not, to such a kissing and hugging as the average
man seldom receives. Then I was escorted to the
little drawing-room and given my favourite chair,
while Molly made tea and my mother sat beside
me and affectionately stroked my hand. Could
you have seen Molly at that moment, you would
have declared her to be the true picture of an
English woman.</p>

<p>As you have probably observed by this
time, I am not much of a hand at describing
people, but I must endeavour to give you some
idea of what my sweetheart was like. In the
first place she was tall, possibly five feet nine
inches. Her eyes were blue, and her hair a rich
nut-brown. On the day of my arrival she was
dressed in white, with a white belt round her
shapely waist; while on the third finger of her
left hand was the ring I had bought for her at
Salisbury after our engagement was announced.
Even now, though ten years have elapsed, I can
feel the joy of that home-coming. I sat sipping
my tea, and eating slice after slice of real Wiltshire
bread-and-butter in a whirl of enchantment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Of course Molly remained to supper with us, and
if afterwards we went for a stroll down the
shadowy lanes as far as Bellam Woods, where
you can stand on the hill and look down the
valley to Salisbury, five miles away, who shall
blame us?</p>

<p>The next three days were about as happy,
so far as I am concerned, as a man could wish
to spend. Fortunately it was holiday time with
Molly, and in consequence she and I were inseparable
from morning until night. We fished
together, went for long walks together, and on
the third day I borrowed the Vicar's pony-cart
and drove her into Salisbury. Alas! however,
that day was destined to end in very different
fashion to what it had begun. Having returned
the pony-cart to the vicarage, we strolled home
together. My mother's maid-of-all-work had
brought in the letters that had arrived by
evening mail, and on the little table in the hall
was one addressed to me. I turned it over, to
discover upon the back of the envelope the monogram
of the Company&mdash;my employers. With
a heart full of forebodings I opened it. It was
very brief, and read as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"I am desired by the Chairman to
inform you that the Board will be glad if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
will make it convenient to be present at their
meeting on Friday next at three o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="i4">"I am,</span><br />
<span class="i6">"Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap i8">J. Hopkinson</span>, Secretary."</p>
</div>

<p>"What does it mean, Dick?" Molly asked.
"Why do they want to see you? I think it is
very unkind of them to spoil your holiday by
taking you away when you only have such a
short time at home."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it means trouble," I answered.
"Captain Harveston and I did not get on very
well together, and I expect he has been making
complaints against me at head-quarters. He
threatened to do so."</p>

<p>"Then he is a very unjust man," said my
sweetheart, her eyes flashing. "And I should
like to tell him so!"</p>

<p>That the letter worried me a good deal I am
not going to deny. My bread-and-butter depended
upon the Company's good opinion, and
if I lost that I should certainly lose my position
too. On the appointed day I bade my dear ones
farewell, walked into Salisbury, and caught the
train to London, reaching the Company's offices,
which were in Leadenhall Street, about a quarter
of an hour before the meeting was due to take
place. A liveried porter showed me into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
waiting-room, where I remained for something
like twenty minutes, kicking my heels impatiently,
and wondering what the end of the
business would be. Then the door opened and
the Secretary entered.</p>

<p>"The Board will see you now, Mr. Helmsworth,"
he said, and I accordingly followed him to
the room in which the meetings of the Company
took place. There I discovered a full Meeting.
The Chairman was seated at the head of the table&mdash;a
dignified, portly personage&mdash;while on either
side of him were ranged the Directors, who I could
see regarded me with some curiosity as I entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. Helmsworth," said the Chairman, after
the Secretary had returned to his place, "we
have requested your presence to-day in order to
inform you that Captain Harveston has felt it
his duty to make a serious complaint to us of
your conduct during the voyage which has just
ended. To be candid, he charges you with
general neglect of duty, of insulting conduct
towards himself, and, I regret to add, of untruthfulness.
We thought it better that you should
have an opportunity of hearing these charges,
and giving you a chance of defending yourself,
should you care to do so. It is needless for
me to add how much the Board regrets that such
a report should have been made against you.
What have you to say?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"All I can say, sir," I replied, advancing to
the bottom of the table, and taking up my
position there, "is that the report has not a
word of truth in it. It is a malicious invention
on the part of Captain Harveston, and, if he were
here, I should tell him so."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Helmsworth, you must not
talk like that," said the Chairman; "Captain
Harveston has been a long time in our service,
and we have never known him act unjustly to
any one. Would it not be better to admit that
there is <i>some</i> truth in what he says, and then
to leave it to the clemency of the Board, to deal
with as they may consider fair?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir," I replied, "with all due
respect to yourself and the Board, that I cannot
submit to being declared neglectful of my duties,
or allow myself to be called untruthful when I
know the charge to be unjust. For some reason,
I cannot say what, Captain Harveston took a
dislike to me before the voyage commenced, and
this report is the outcome of that dislike."</p>

<p>I then proceeded to explain what had happened;
pointed out that while the dock workmen
were engaged upon the ship, and she was
of necessity in an untidy condition, Captain
Harveston had complained of her lack of orderliness.
I referred to the paint incident, and commented
upon the fact that he had charged me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with concealing what had happened from him.
With regard to the ship being in an untidy state
throughout the voyage, I stated that I was prepared
to bring witnesses to prove that she was
as perfect as it was possible for a ship to be. If
a little of the gloss had worn off by the time we
reached the Thames, I explained that it was due
to the fact that we had experienced very rough
weather in the Bay and also coming up Channel.
The charge of untruthfulness I dismissed as being
both petty and absurd. Towards the end of my
remarks I had some difficulty in restraining my
temper, for I could see that the Board was still
inclined to side with the captain against me.
Perhaps my manner was not submissive enough
to please them. At any rate when they asked
me to withdraw for a few minutes while they
discussed the matter, I began to feel that my
case was, so far as they were concerned, a hopeless
one. After ten minutes' absence I was
recalled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Helmsworth," the Chairman began in
his dignified way, polishing his glasses with his
pocket-handkerchief as he spoke, "we have most
carefully gone into the matter, and have arrived
at the conclusion that, taking into consideration
the length of time you have been in the Company's
service, and the fact that there have
never been any complaints against you hitherto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
we should be justified in permitting you an
opportunity of retrieving any little error you
may have committed. If, therefore, you will
agree to apologize to Captain Harveston, and
will promise to do your best in the future, I
may say on behalf of the Board, that we are prepared
to allow this most painful matter to drop."</p>

<p>This was more than I had bargained for. I
had at least hoped that they would have given
orders that I should be confronted with my
accuser, and that I should be allowed to call
witnesses in my own defence.</p>

<p>"With all due respect, gentlemen," I said,
with perhaps more freedom than I should have
used, "I cannot submit to such a thing. Captain
Harveston has brought these charges against me
for some reason best known to himself. It seems
to me, if only in common fairness, that he should
be called upon to prove them, and if he is unable
to do so, to apologize to me for the wrong he has
done me. I declare most emphatically that I
am innocent, and, if you will allow me, I will
prove it. I am sure my brother officers will be
able to convince you as to my ability, and to the
state of the ship. The Dock Superintendent
should also be able to do the same."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the Dock Superintendent
has confirmed the captain's opinion," said the
Chairman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>To my chagrin, I remembered then that the
Dock Superintendent and I had had a quarrel
some years before, and also that he was a great
friend of the captain's. It was not likely, therefore,
that he would side with me.</p>

<p>"If the Dock Superintendent says that, I
suppose I must submit," I answered. "Nevertheless,
I contend that neither he nor Captain
Harveston is speaking the truth."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," said one of the Directors,
"this is really not the sort of behaviour to which
we are accustomed. Why not take the Chairman's
advice, Mr. Helmsworth, and apologize to
your captain? I am quite sure that he would
bear no malice to you, and the matter could then
be amicably settled."</p>

<p>This had the same effect upon me as the
waving of a red flag is said to have upon an
angry bull.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly not apologize," I answered.
"Captain Harveston is in the wrong, and I refuse
to have anything more to do with him."</p>

<p>"In that case, I am afraid the consequences
will be serious," said the Chairman. "We
should be loath to lose your services, Mr.
Helmsworth, particularly after your long service,
but unless you apologize to Captain Harveston,
we have no other course open to us."</p>

<p>"I shall not do that," I returned, "and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
case of my dismissal I assure you I shall immediately
take what proceedings the law allows
me, in order to prove that I have been slandered
most grossly."</p>

<p>The Board stared at me in amazement. Was
it possible, they were doubtless asking themselves,
that a miserable chief officer dared to
beard them in this fashion?</p>

<p>"What proceedings you take against Captain
Harveston are no concern of ours, after you
have quitted our employment," said the Chairman,
"but if you will be well advised, you will
think twice before you invoke the assistance of
the law."</p>

<p>"I am to understand, therefore," I said, "that
I am dismissed."</p>

<p>"No, no," the Chairman replied; "we will not
go as far as that, we will call it a resignation."</p>

<p>"Allow me then to wish you good-day,
gentlemen," I said, and bowing I walked out
of the room. "You will, doubtless, hear from
me later."</p>

<p>"A pretty market I have brought my pigs
to," I said to myself, as I walked down Leadenhall
Street, after leaving the offices of the
Company. "Poor little Molly, this will be a
sad blow to her. It looks as if my marriage is
now further off than ever."</p>

<p>How little I guessed then that the interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
I had just had, had brought it closer than if
the trouble with Harveston had never occurred.
Acting on the resolve I had made while waiting
for the Board's decision, I made my way in the
direction of High Holborn. The old lawyer
who had conducted what little legal business
my father had required, and who had arranged
my mother's affairs after his death, had an
office in one of the curious old Inns of Court
in that neighbourhood. I determined to lay the
case before him and to act according to the
advice he gave me. On reaching the office I
had the satisfaction of finding him at home.
The clerk, who received me, was as old as his
employer, and I believe had served him for
upwards of forty years. His memory for faces
must have been a good one, for he recognized
me at once, although several years had elapsed
since I had last called upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Winzor is in his office, Mr. Helmsworth,"
he said, "and, if you will be good enough to
wait for a moment, I will place your name before
him." He disappeared, and presently returned
and requested me to follow him.</p>

<p>The old lawyer received me most cordially
and invited me to take a seat. He asked
after my mother's health, then took a pinch
of snuff, looked at me fixedly, and then took
another. After this he inquired in what way<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he could serve me. I thereupon placed the case
before him.</p>

<p>"This is a matter," he said, after a pause of
about a minute, "that will require very careful
consideration. It is plain that the captain in
question is a vindictive man. His reason for
being so bitter against you is difficult to understand,
but we have the best of evidence before
us that it does exist. It's one thing, however,
to be unjustly treated, and quite another to go
to law about it. In a somewhat lengthy career,
it has always been my endeavour to impress one
thing upon my clients&mdash;Don't go to law if you
can possibly avoid it. Doubtless were you to
take the case into court we could produce sufficient
evidence from your brother officers and
the petty officers of the ship to prove that you
did your duty, and also that you were a conscientious
officer. But, even supposing you won
the day, how would you stand?"</p>

<p>"I should have reinstated my character," I
replied somewhat sharply, for the old man's
manner grated upon me.</p>

<p>"And apart from the question of character,
how much better off would you be?" he asked.
"The fact of your calling the officers of the ship
would put the Company to a considerable amount
of inconvenience and expense, which they would
naturally resent. It would also have the effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of putting them in an antagonistic attitude
towards yourself, which, at present, they do not
appear anxious to take up. The case would
attract some attention, the various shipping
companies would read it, and, should you apply
to them for a position, I fear you would find
them averse to taking an officer who, you must
forgive my plain speaking, was ready to invoke
the aid of the law to settle his disputes with
his captain and his employers. Do you see my
contention?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see it," I replied; "but, surely, you
don't mean to say that I am to have this injustice
done me and say nothing about it?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do not see what else to advise
you to do," he replied. "I think you have
been badly treated, but, upon my word, though
if I were in your place I should doubtless feel
as you do, I should drop the matter, and, to
quote a familiar Stock Exchange expression, 'cut
the losses.'"</p>

<p>This was not at all what I had expected, and
boiling over as I was, the advice he gave me
was most unpalatable. He must have seen this,
for he tapped me gently on the arm.</p>

<p>"Master Richard," he said, as if he were
talking to a school-boy, "I am an old man and
you are a young one. Youth is proverbially
hot-headed, while Age is apt to stand off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
looks at things from afar. I pledge you my
word that, in giving you this advice, I am
acting as I deem best for your welfare. There
is an old saying to the effect that 'there are
as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it,'
and I fancy the same remark can be made to
apply to the vessels sailing upon that sea. Now
will you leave the matter in my hands?"</p>

<p>"Most willingly," I replied, "provided I am
not going to continue to be suspected of being a
malingerer and a liar."</p>

<p>"Sir Alexander Godfrey, the Chairman of the
Company," he went on, "is a personal friend
of my own, and if you will allow me, I will
make a point of calling upon him to-morrow
in order to have a chat with him upon the
subject. I cannot promise, but I think I shall
be able to induce him to persuade his brother
Directors to either look over the matter, or at
any rate to make sure that you leave the
Company's service without any stain upon your
character."</p>

<p>"But to do that I must be proved innocent."</p>

<p>The old man smiled a crafty smile.</p>

<p>"When you are as old as I am," he said,
"you will have discovered that there are ways
and ways of doing things. Leave it to me to
arrange and I fancy you will be satisfied with
the result."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let it be so, then," I replied.</p>

<p>"I am not a vain man," he said, "but I will
say that I do not think you could do better.
Now tell me how the pretty Miss Molly is."</p>

<p>"She is very well indeed," I replied, "but
I fancy this news will be a disappointment to
her."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," he answered. "It's just
at such times as these that the real woman
comes out. Egad! you youngsters think you
understand women, but, bless my heart, you
don't! And now you just trot back to Wiltshire,
and give my kindest remembrances to
your mother, and, well, if you like, you can give
a kiss to Miss Molly for me. Tell her not to
bother herself; that I will see you out of this
affair all right. I am very glad, my lad, that
you came to me. When you are in trouble I
hope you will always do so. Your father and I
were old friends, and&mdash;well, I am not going to
say anything further, but I'll tell you this;
if I had met your mother before your father
did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly and tapped his snuff-box
upon the table, then he rose from his
chair, shook me by the hand, and told me he
would write me immediately he had anything
of importance to tell me.</p>

<p>I took this as a signal for dismissal, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
thanking him for his advice, left him. Twenty
minutes later I caught the three o'clock express
at Waterloo, and in something under two hours
was back in Wiltshire once more.</p>

<p>Molly met me half-way out of Salisbury,
and her loving sympathy cheered me more than
anything else could have done.</p>

<p>"Don't be miserable about it," she said, when
I had told her everything; "there are plenty
of ships in the world, and lots of owners who
will value your services more than this Company
seems to have done. Remember, I believe
in you with my whole heart, dear, and if it is
decreed that we are not to be married for some
time to come, then we must wait with all patience
until that happy day shall dawn. When you've
had a little more holiday, you can begin to look
about you for something else."</p>

<p>Could any man have wished for a braver
sweetheart? Alas! however, matters were not
destined at first to turn out as happily as she
had prophesied. I applied to firm after firm,
but my efforts in every case were entirely
unsuccessful. At last I began to think that if
my luck did not mend very soon, I should have
to pocket my pride and ship as second or third
officer, hoping by perseverance and hard work
to get back to my old position later on. This
eventually I decided to do, but even then I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not successful. The only line which could offer
me anything was in the Russian grain trade, and
the best berth they had vacant was that of third
officer. As may be supposed, this was a bit of a
come-down for my pride, and before accepting
it, for I had run up to London to interview the
firm in question, I returned to Falstead to talk it
over with my sweetheart. On my reaching home
my mother greeted me with an air of importance.</p>

<p>"A gentleman has been to see you this afternoon,"
she said, "a tall, handsome man. He
did not leave his name, but he said you would
probably remember him, as he had met you on
board the <i>Pernambuco</i>. He is staying at the
George, and is most anxious to see you."</p>

<p>"I met a good many people on board the
<i>Pernambuco</i>," I said a little bitterly. "A lot
of them were tall and handsome. I wonder who
he can be?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You say that he is staying at the George,"
I continued. "Very well, when I have had my
tea, I will go down and find out who he is."</p>

<p>In due course I reached the little inn at the
end of the village street. The proprietress, old
Mrs. Newman, had known me since I was so high,
and upon my entering her carefully-sanded
parlour, she bustled out of her little room at
the back to greet me. I inquired whether she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
had a strange gentleman staying in the house,
and she answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"He is smoking a cigar in the bower at the
end of the garden," she answered. "If you
want to see him you will find him there."</p>

<p>I knew the place in question, and, passing
through the house, made my way down the
garden towards the little summer-house in
question. Seated in it, looking just the same
as when I had last seen him, was the Spaniard,
Don Guzman de Silvestre.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">[Pg 43]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>On seeing me Don Guzman sprang to his feet
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," he cried, "it is very good of
you to come here. I called at your house this
afternoon, to learn that you were in London,
but that you were expected back this evening.
Doubtless you are surprised at seeing me, but
when I tell you everything, I fancy your wonderment
will cease. Won't you sit down and let me
offer you a cigar? A more delightful spot than
your village I have never met with."</p>

<p>I accepted his cigar, and seated myself in the
wicker chair he pushed forward for my accommodation.
What he was doing in our quiet
neighbourhood I could not for the life of me
imagine. But when I remembered the questions
he had put to me on board the <i>Pernambuco</i>, I
began to feel my hopes rising. It would be a
stroke of luck indeed if he were to offer me a
good berth, just at the moment when I needed
it so badly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so our mutual acquaintance, Captain
Harveston, played you a shabby trick after all?"
he remarked after a short pause.</p>

<p>"He could not very well have done me a
greater injury," I replied. "What is worse, I
fear he has not only lost me my berth, but that
he has prejudiced other owners against me. Did
the ship strike you as being in a badly-kept
condition when you were on board?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one better managed in my life,"
he answered. "At the same time I must confess
that I am not sorry that Harveston has got you
your discharge."</p>

<p>"As matters stand with me just now, that's
not a particularly civil thing to say, is it?" I
inquired with some asperity, for, if the truth
must be confessed, I was not in a very good
humour.</p>

<p>"My friend, I mean it in all kindness," he
answered, "and presently I will tell you why.
Do you remember that story I told you on
board, about my acquaintance who had played
the vagabond all over the world?"</p>

<p>"The man who was President of one of the
Republics of South America?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Exactly, the same man."</p>

<p>"I recollect the story perfectly," I replied.
"But what makes you speak of that man?"</p>

<p>"Well, what I am going to say to you concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that man. He has a very strong notion
that if he could only get his rival out of the
country in question, he might manage to win his
way back to his old position."</p>

<p>"But will the other allow himself to be enticed
out of the country? That seems to me to be
the question. Besides, it's one of the rules of
the game, is it not, that the President shall never
cross the Border?"</p>

<p>"That is certainly so, but circumstances alter
cases. In this affair, if the man cannot be induced
to go out of his own free-will, others must
make him do so."</p>

<p>"Rather a risky concern, I should fancy."</p>

<p>"Everything in this world possesses some
element of risk," he replied, "whether it is a
question of buying Mexican Rails or English
Consols, backing a racehorse, or going a long
railway journey. In this affair there is a little
more than usual, perhaps; at the same time the
reward is great."</p>

<p>"On the other hand, supposing you fail," I
returned, "what then? You would probably find
yourself, in a remarkably short space of time,
standing against a wall, with your eyes bandaged,
and half-a-dozen rifles preparing to pump lead
into you. Have you taken that fact into your
calculations?"</p>

<p>"I have not omitted to think of it," he replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
gravely, as if it were a point worthy of consideration.
"Still, that is not what I am concerned
about just at present."</p>

<p>"But what have I to do with this?" I
inquired, for, though it seems wonderful now
that I should not have thought of it, I had not
the very faintest notion of what he was driving
at then.</p>

<p>"If you like, you can have a good deal to do
with it," he answered, blowing a cloud of smoke
into the air, and bestowing an approving glance
at his exquisitely made boots. "I think when
I had the pleasure of meeting you on board the
<i>Pernambuco</i>, you told me that you were engaged
to be married?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am <i>engaged</i>," I answered, "but
when I shall be able to get married is another
and a very different matter. I've lost my
position, and with it has gone my hope of soon
being made a skipper. I can't very well risk
matrimony on the pay of a third officer of a
grain boat, can I?"</p>

<p>"I should say that it would hardly be prudent,"
he answered. "May I ask what capital you
would require to start married life upon?"</p>

<p>"I should be perfectly happy if I had three
hundred a year," I replied. "I'm not a man
with big notions, and I fancy that sum would
meet our wants."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Capitalized at three per cent., shall we say
ten thousand pounds? You are certainly not of
a grasping nature, Mr. Helmsworth!"</p>

<p>"It would be all the same if I were," I
answered. "At the present moment I stand as
much chance of getting ten thousand pounds as
I do of getting a million."</p>

<p>"I am not quite so sure of that," he said,
speaking very slowly. Then he looked at me
out of half-closed eyes, and eventually added:
"What if I were in a position to put in your
way the sum you want?"</p>

<p>I stared at him in surprise. Then I grew
distrustful. Experience has taught me that
our fellow-man does not pay away ten thousand
pounds unless he is very certain of getting a
good return for his generosity.</p>

<p>"I should be inclined to think that you were
jesting with me," I replied, when I had recovered
from the astonishment his remark had caused
me.</p>

<p>"No, no; don't say that," he answered. "I
assure you I am not jesting at all. I very rarely
do so. I say definitely that it is in my power to
put that sum of money in your way. That is,
of course, provided you care to earn it."</p>

<p>"How am I to do that? That may make all
the difference."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't look so scared," he returned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
"the matter is a very simple one. All I require
in exchange for the ten thousand pounds is your
co-operation in a certain political act."</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand," I replied, as the truth
dawned upon me. "The ex-President of the
South American Republic, whom you call your
friend, is in reality yourself, and you want me to
help you get back your position. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "and I pay you the
compliment of saying that I think you are just
the man to bring that result about. I have not
arrived at this decision haphazard. I watched
you very closely on board the <i>Pernambuco</i>, and
I have made inquiries about you since. It is
a piece of my usual good fortune that you
should happen to be disengaged at this particular
time. Had you not been, I should have made
you an offer, in the hope of having been able to
induce you to leave the Company's service, and to
join me. That would have been unfortunate, and
it might very probably have given rise to suspicion,
and suspicion is the one thing of all others I am
naturally anxious to avoid. In England they
do not appreciate the subtleties of South American
politics, and in consequence they are apt to look
at things in a wrong light. Would you have
any objection to assisting me to regain my
former position?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"It all depends upon what you want me to
do," I replied. "I have had no experience in
such affairs, and am afraid I should make a poor
conspirator."</p>

<p>"There is no need for you to be a conspirator
at all," he said, with one of his quiet laughs,
"that is to say, not in the sense you mean.
All I am going to ask of you is the exercise of a
little diplomacy, and some of that nautical skill
which I am so well aware you possess."</p>

<p>"In other words, you want me to assist in the
deportation of your rival from the country, whose
chief he at present is."</p>

<p>"You've hit the mark exactly," he returned.
"That is just what I <i>want</i> you to do, and it is
for this that I am willing to pay the sum of ten
thousand pounds, which will enable you to marry
the girl of your heart. Now let me hear what
you think."</p>

<p>"I scarcely know what answer to give you," I
replied. "I have never dreamt that I should
be asked such a question. It is all so unexpected."</p>

<p>"Is there not an English saying to the effect
that it is the unexpected always happens?" he
inquired. "I want to have your decision as
quickly as possible, for the reason that, if you
don't like the thought of taking on the work, I
must find somebody else who does. I think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
know your character as well as any man can do,
and I am certain I can trust you."</p>

<p>I thanked him for the compliment he paid me,
and then informed him that, before I could give
him a definite answer, I must hear more of his
scheme.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would take rather too long to
tell you just now," he replied, when he had
consulted his watch. "Won't you dine with
me? We could talk the matter over more
thoroughly afterwards. I suppose the landlady
can give us some sort of a meal?"</p>

<p>As it was the evening on which Molly had her
choir practice, and I knew that I should not see
her until ten o'clock, I accepted his invitation,
on the condition that I should be allowed to go
home first in order to acquaint my mother of my
intention. He agreed to this, and I thereupon
left him and went off on my errand. As I
walked down the quiet little street, I thought of
the curious proposal the Don had made to me.
It seemed almost impossible that I, quiet Dick
Helmsworth, should be asked to undertake the
abduction of a South American President. So
far, I knew next to nothing of Don Guzman's
scheme; but I had a very fair idea of the risk I
should be called upon to run. Ten thousand
pounds was a very large sum; but would it be
large enough to compensate me for what I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
have to undergo, should my attempt prove unsuccessful,
and I find myself in captivity? Then
there was another question. What would Molly
say when she heard of it? Would she approve,
or should I refrain from telling her anything
about it? This was a point I felt that demanded
most earnest consideration. Entering the house,
I informed my mother of the invitation I had
received to dine with Don Guzman.</p>

<p>"It will do you good, my boy," she said
instantly. "You want a little cheering up after
the troubles you have had lately. Who is the
gentleman?"</p>

<p>I informed her that I had met him on my last
voyage, that he was a Spaniard, and also that he
was presumably very wealthy.</p>

<p>"I have only known one Spaniard in my life,"
the old lady continued, "and I cannot say that
I liked him. Your father did not consider him
trustworthy. But there, your gentleman may
be quite a different sort of person."</p>

<p>On my way back to the inn I pondered over
my mother's words. She had all an old
Englishwoman's innate distrust of foreigners;
but her innocent little remark had set my imagination
working. What if Don Guzman should be
hoodwinking me, and that there was more behind
his offer than I imagined? I then and there
made up my mind not to take a step forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
until I should be thoroughly convinced as to his
<i>bon&acirc; fides</i>.</p>

<p>On reaching the inn, I was informed by Mrs.
Newman that the Don, or the foreign gentleman,
as she styled him, was awaiting me in the coffee-room.
Thither I repaired, to discover the table
laid and my host standing at the window looking
out upon the garden. He received me with
much politeness, and we presently sat down to
our meal together. During its progress nothing
was said regarding the scheme we had discussed
an hour before. The Don did the honours of
the table with the greatest courtesy, and in
numerous little ways showed me that whatever
else he might be, he was certainly a keen judge
of Human Character. As I have already
remarked, he had travelled in well-nigh every
country, and if his own accounts were to be
believed, he had met with some strange people,
and some still stranger adventures.</p>

<p>Our meal at an end, he proposed that we
should go for a stroll, and to this I assented.
We accordingly left the inn, and walked down
the main street past the ancient village church,
until we came to the stone bridge that spans
the river. It was a glorious evening; the sunset
had been a brilliant one, and the last faint tints
still lingered in the sky. Under the bridge the
river stole noiselessly on its way to the sea; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
swallows darted up and down its glassy surface
as if they were resolved to make the most of
the waning daylight; while, soft and low, from
across the meadow came the music of the church
organ, where Molly was instructing her boys in
the music for the coming Sunday. It was an
evening I shall remember as long as I can
recollect anything, if only because of the strange
events which might almost be said to have
dated from it.</p>

<p>"I hope you have been favourably considering
my scheme," said Don Guzman, when we had
seated ourselves on the stone balustrading of
the bridge, and I was idly dropping stones into
the stream below.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've certainly given the matter my
consideration," I replied, "but I want to hear
something more of your plans, and to know
exactly what will be required of me, before I
shall be able to give you a definite decision.
Remember, beyond the mere fact that you want
to get this man out of the country, I know
nothing whatsoever of the business."</p>

<p>"I promised you an explanation, and you shall
have it," he said. "Of course, before I begin,
I can rely upon your treating the matter as
strictly confidential, can I not? You can see
for yourself the position I should be placed in
were you not to do so."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Most assuredly," I replied. "I pledge you
my word that whatever you may say to me
regarding this matter shall go no further."</p>

<p>"In that case I will begin. First and foremost,
let me inform you that the country in question
is the Republic of Equinata. As doubtless you
are aware, it is a most prosperous and fruitful one;
indeed, I know of no other that I like so well.
I lived some of the most pleasant years of my
life there, and should in all probability be residing
there now if it were not for the treachery of
the man whom I thought to be my friend, who
became my adviser, and eventually ended in
ousting me from my position and assuming the
reins of Government himself. The name of
that man is Manuel Fernandez; he is about
fifty years of age, of iron physique, and I will
do him the credit of saying, of indomitable
courage. His subjects do not love him, but
they fear him, which is much more to the
point. Whether I was loved or not I am
unable to state, but the fact remains that a large
number of the population are most anxious that
I should return to them to take up my former
position. This I am very anxious to do, but I do
not see how I am to accomplish it unless the
present President is out of the way. Doubtless
I could enter the country by stealth, and sow
the seeds of another Revolution, which might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
or might not, be successful. But there would
always be the danger of Fernandez discovering
my whereabouts and putting me out of the way.
Now, my idea is this, if we could only manage
to get him out of the country, I could return,
rally my friends about me, prove his flight, and
proclaim myself Dictator. That done, even
should he return in the end, I should be
prepared for him."</p>

<p>"But how do you propose to get him out of
the country?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I want you to manage,"
he answered. "With the plan I have in my
mind, and a little care, it should not be a difficult
matter. This is my scheme. Lying at a certain
port on the Florida coast is a large steam-yacht,
of upwards of a thousand tons. She is the
property of an old friend and sympathizer of
mine in the United States. He has offered to
lend her to me for the purpose in hand. Now, if
you are willing to assist me, you might go out to
the West Indies, join her at Barbadoes, and board
her in the capacity of a rich Englishman. You
steam away to Equinata, and go ashore, in order
to study the customs of her people. Most naturally
you would call upon the President to pay
your respects. You are invited to call again, in
the end you strike up a friendship, then one
evening he dines with you on board, or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
you meet him somewhere, and then&mdash;well, I will
leave the rest to your imagination."</p>

<p>Here he looked at me meaningly, and I
gathered what his thoughts were.</p>

<p>"And what is to happen to him then?"</p>

<p>"After that you steam away to a certain
small island the name of which I will give you,
land him, and place him with some people who
will take charge of him until such a time as
shall be agreed upon. It should not be a difficult
matter, should it?"</p>

<p>"No, as you put it, it is simplicity itself," I
replied; "but what about the officers and men
of the yacht? How will you prevent them from
talking? And, what is more, will they assist in
the scheme?"</p>

<p>"They will be most carefully chosen for the
work," the other replied. "You need have no
fear that they will give trouble. Now what do
you say?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what answer to make. Supposing
I am caught? What would happen then?"</p>

<p>"You will stand a very good chance of being
shot offhand," he answered; "but that, of course,
is your own risk. It will depend entirely upon
how you go to work."</p>

<p>"It would be running a terrible risk," I
answered. "I have the girl I am going to
marry to think of."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you succeed, you will be able to marry her
on your return to England," he replied. "Surely
<i>that</i> counts for something."</p>

<p>"It counts for everything," I replied. "That's
the temptation; if it were not for that, I'd have
nothing to do with it. I must have time,
however, to consider the matter."</p>

<p>"By all means," he answered, "but don't
be any longer than you can help. As I said
a few minutes ago, if you don't care about
undertaking it, I must find some one else.
Time presses."</p>

<p>"In case I do take it on, when will it be
necessary for me to start?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better," he replied. "If you
can see your way to doing so, I should like you
to leave by next week's mail boat for Barbadoes,
where the yacht will meet you."</p>

<p>"Will it satisfy you if I give you my answer
to-morrow morning?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow morning will suit me admirably,"
he answered. "And if you decide in the
affirmative, my cheque for five thousand pounds
shall be handed you at once, and the remainder
on the day you deliver the President to the
representative whom I shall appoint. Do you
consider that proposition a fair one?"</p>

<p>"Very fair indeed," I replied. "I could not
wish for anything more so."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we strolled back along the road until we
reached the lych-gate of the churchyard. Here
I bade him good-night, and he continued his
walk. On my part, I made my way into the
church, and seated myself in one of the pews
until the practice should be finished. From
where I sat I could catch a glimpse of my
darling's pretty figure at the organ in the chancel,
the light from the two candles on either side
illumining her face. When the practice was at
an end, she dismissed her boys and came down to
join me. Then, bidding the old verger a good-night,
we made our way home together. She
inquired how I had enjoyed my dinner, and
what my friend had had to say to me. This put
me in rather a dilemma, for, of course, having
given my word, I could say nothing to her
regarding the subject of our conversation. I
explained, however, that he had come down to
consult me on some important business connected
with Central America, and that he had proposed
that I should go over and transact it for
him.</p>

<p>"He, at least, must have great faith in your
ability then, Dick," said my sweetheart. "I am
prepared to like him, even though he does monopolize
your society. I know you will transact
the business beautifully, and then perhaps it may
lead to something really good for you." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
paused for a moment, and then added a little
nervously, "When will you have to start?"</p>

<p>"Next week, if I go at all," I replied; "but I
have not yet decided whether or not I shall
accept his offer."</p>

<p>"You must act as your own judgment dictates,"
she continued. "I know that whatever you
decide to do will be right."</p>

<p>All things considered, I was not quite so
certain of this myself, and for a moment I was
tempted to declare I would have nothing whatsoever
to do with it. But the money and the
knowledge that it would mean a wife and happiness
for me, if I succeeded, was a temptation
I could not resist.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, I did not sleep very
much that night, but tumbled and tossed upon
my bed, turning the momentous question over
and over in my mind in maddening reiteration.
There was one side of it that was unpleasantly
suggestive. I had to remember that, if I were
caught, no power on earth could save me. My
own Government would certainly not interfere
in such a matter, while Don Guzman would, far
from taking any responsibility, in all probability,
repudiate entirely any connection with me and
the affair. Then, from this, back I came again
in the circle of argument to the one absorbing
question of the money. Five thousand down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and five thousand when I handed over the
President. It would be a fortune to me. If
I had it, I need never go to sea again, and
Molly would be my&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove," I said to myself as I sprang
from my bed, "I'll do it! Come what may, I'll
do it, and chance the risk."</p>

<p>Having arrived at this resolve, I had my tub,
ate my breakfast, and after I had smoked a
meditative pipe in the garden, and had given
the matter a bit more consideration, set off for
the inn where Don Guzman was staying. He
had only just risen, and was about to begin his
breakfast when I entered the room.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, as we shook hands, "what
news have you for me?"</p>

<p>"I have come <i>to accept your proposal</i>," I
said.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">[Pg 61]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>"I am indeed glad you have decided to help
me," Don Guzman de Silvestre replied, when
he heard my reply. "I felt certain you would
accept, and I assure you I shall value your co-operation.
Would it be possible for you to leave
England on Wednesday next?"</p>

<p>"If it comes to that I must make it possible,"
I answered. "From what you said to me last
night, I gather that there is no time to be
lost."</p>

<p>"The sooner we get to work the better," he
returned. "I will send a cipher message to the
States this morning, to ask my friend to have the
yacht in readiness. If you leave London on the
sixteenth you should reach Barbadoes on the
twenty-ninth. The yacht will meet you there,
and from the moment you set foot on board her,
you may regard her as your own private property
to use as you will. You will find her
captain a most reliable man, and he will receive
orders to do his utmost to assist you. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
discharge all expenses, and will be held responsible
for the working of the vessel and the
crew. You will, of course, be known on board
by another name, which we must arrange, and
you will be supposed to be a young Englishman,
of immense wealth, whose particular hobby is
yachting. In order to sustain the fiction, it
will be necessary for you to have a large and
varied outfit, which I think you had better order
to-day. I shall leave England a week after you
do, and shall go direct to the island, where you
are to hand the President over to me."</p>

<p>"But you have not told me the name of that
island yet," I answered.</p>

<p>He took a map from his pocket and unfolded
it upon the table. Then placing his finger on a
small dot in the Caribbean Sea, some distance
from the Republic of Equinata, he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"There it is! It is called San Diaz, and is a
picturesque little place. The man who owns it
is monarch of all he surveys. If we can once get
Fernandez there, all will be well. No vessels call
at the island, and, unless he likes to attempt a long
swim, which I should be the last to prevent, I
fancy he will find some difficulty in returning to
the mainland."</p>

<p>Another thought flashed through my mind.</p>

<p>"Before we go any further," I said, "there is
one thing I should say to you. It is this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Before I take any hand in the business, I must
have your positive assurance that no violence
will be used towards the man you are so anxious
to secure. I could not be a party to anything of
that sort, nor could I possibly deliver him to
you if I thought you meant to do him any ill."</p>

<p>"I will give you the assurance for which you
ask most willingly," my companion replied
without hesitation. "I merely desire to keep
Fernandez out of Equinata for a time, that is to
say, while I reinstate myself in my old position."</p>

<p>When I was satisfied on this point, we discussed
various other details connected with the
scheme, and the part I was to play in it. It was
certainly a big business.</p>

<p>"So far as I am concerned," said Silvestre,
"I'm going to be selfish enough to say that I
think it is a pity you are going to be married.
As President of the Republic, I could make your
fortune for you in a very short time. You
wouldn't care to bring your wife out to Equinata
and settle down there, I suppose. I'd like to
have a man beside me whom I felt sure I could
trust."</p>

<p>"Many thanks for the compliment you pay
me," I replied. "I fear, however, South
American politics are a little too uncertain for
my taste."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you are right," he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
meditatively, as if he were considering the
matter; "but you must at least admit that, as
compared with the House of Commons, there is
some life in them."</p>

<p>"I should be inclined to substitute the word
'death' for 'life,'" I returned, thinking of the
stories I had been told of the thousands who had
perished during the last Revolution. "And now
I must go. I have all my work cut out for me if
I am to sail on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Before you leave me," he remarked, "I had
better give you this!"</p>

<p>So saying, he took from his pocket a Russian
leather case. From it he produced a draft on a
London banking firm, which he handed to me.
It was for no less a sum than six thousand
pounds. This was more than I had expected
to receive. I therefore asked his reason for
adding the extra amount.</p>

<p>"It is for your expenses," he replied. "For
many reasons it would be better that I should
not be brought into the business. You had,
therefore, better book your passage yourself.
You will also have to get the outfit of which I
spoke just now. That will cost a good deal.
What is left should suffice for your other
expenses, which, in your capacity of a rich
young Englishman, you will probably find
heavy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>This was generous treatment, and I said as
much.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he answered. "Believe me, I
am only too glad to do it. I count myself lucky
in having secured your services, and I am willing
to pay for that good fortune. Well, now that I
have arranged matters with you, I shall return
to London and set the ball rolling in the various
directions. If you could make it convenient to
meet me on Monday next, I could then tell you
how matters progressed, and we could discuss
future proceedings together. Here is my address."</p>

<p>With that he handed me his card, which I
placed carefully in my pocket-book with the
cheque. After that, having promised to call
upon him on the day mentioned, I bade him
good-bye, and returned to my own home.</p>

<p>Great indeed was my mother's consternation
on learning that she was to lose me again so
soon. She had counted, she declared, upon
having me for another month at least. Molly
tried to be brave, but the effort was not a
conspicuous success.</p>

<p>"Never mind, darling," I said, "we must put
the best face we can upon it. It is a fine chance
for me. If I am successful, we shall be able to
be married when I return, and I shall then be
able to give up the sea. So we must cheer up
and look forward to that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"It should be very important business you are
to be engaged upon if you will be able to do
that," she answered, looking up at me with her
trusting, loving eyes.</p>

<p>"It is most important," I answered. "The
biggest thing I have ever had to do with. Some
day, perhaps, I may be able to let you know
more about it, but at present my lips are sealed."</p>

<p>"Tell me nothing but what you wish, dear,"
she answered, like the good little woman she was.
"I am quite content to wait."</p>

<p>After lunch she walked into Salisbury with
me, and did her shopping, while I visited the
bank, where I paid in my cheque, and then went
on to the tailor's to arrange about my outfit. It
is doubtful whether the firm in question had ever
had such an order before, and for once in my life
I took rank as a person of importance in their
eyes. They would have been more surprised, I
fancy, had they known the reason of my wanting
it all! The next thing to be done was to telegraph
for a passage to Barbadoes. This I did in
my own name, and, as the transaction was with
my old firm, I could well imagine the surprise
my communication would cause them. A letter
I had already written followed the wire, and
conveyed the passage money. After that the
matter was settled. I had nothing to do now
but to make the most of my time with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
mother and Molly, before it should be necessary
for me to leave for London.</p>

<p>When that day arrived I walked into Salisbury
and took the train to Waterloo. Thence I
made my way to the fashionable hotel at which
Guzman de Silvestre was staying. He was in
the act of going out as I entered, but on seeing
me he led me back to his sitting-room and carefully
closed the door.</p>

<p>"I am very glad indeed to see you," he said,
placing a chair for me as he spoke. "I trust
your preparations are progressing satisfactorily?"</p>

<p>"Everything is prepared," I answered. "I
shall join the vessel on Wednesday morning in
the docks. The receipt for my passage money
arrived this morning."</p>

<p>"It does me good to meet so expeditious a
person," he remarked, with a smile. "I, on my
side, have not been idle. I have received a cable
from the folk in Florida to the effect that the
yacht will reach Barbadoes on the twenty-sixth,
where she will await your arrival. After that
I leave the conduct of affairs in your hands
entirely."</p>

<p>"I trust I shall be able to carry it through,"
I answered. "I only wish I had a little more
confidence in my ability to succeed."</p>

<p>"You'll manage it, never fear," Silvestre
replied. "I am as certain that I shall one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
see Fernandez coming ashore at San Diaz, as
I am of eating my dinner to-night."</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," I hastened to remark,
"that there is still one thing that puzzles me."</p>

<p>"And what may that be?" he inquired.
"Don't hesitate to ask any questions you may
think of. This is no time for half confidences."</p>

<p>"I want to know why, with all your experience,
and the number of men you have met,
you should have selected me for this business.
Surely you could have discovered hundreds of
others better fitted for the work."</p>

<p>"To be candid with you," he returned, "I
chose you because I liked the look of you. You
seemed to be just the sort of man I wanted. I
won't deny that I know lots of men who might
have been able to carry it through successfully
had it come to a pinch, but the chances are that
they might have failed in some little thing, and
that would have given rise to suspicion. I
wanted an Englishman, and one possessed of
the manners and appearance of a gentleman.
Allow me to pay you the compliment of saying
that in my opinion you combine both these
qualifications."</p>

<p>"It is very good of you to say so," I replied,
"but I don't quite see what the appearance of a
gentleman has to do with the question."</p>

<p>"I will explain," he said. "Fernandez, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
have already told you, is an adventurer himself.
He knows the type, and, for that reason, would
be quick to detect a brother hawk. One suspicion
would give rise to another, and then, you may
rest assured, the attempt to remove him would
be frustrated. Now you can see why I want
some one who can play the part and yet not
rouse his suspicions."</p>

<p>"And so I am to be a gentleman in manners
and appearances&mdash;and yet be a traitor in reality.
I don't know that I consider it altogether a nice
part to be called upon to play."</p>

<p>"You must settle that with your own conscience,"
he answered, with one of his peculiar
smiles. "Call it an act of political expediency,
and thus settle all qualms."</p>

<p>After that I put a few further questions to him
concerning certain contingencies that might occur
in the event of the President obtaining an inkling
of what was toward. When all this was arranged,
I left him, at the same time promising to call
upon him on Wednesday for final instructions.</p>

<p>From the hotel I drove to Mr. Winzor's offices
in High Holborn. He was not in at the moment,
but when I returned, half-an-hour or so later, I
found him ready to receive me.</p>

<p>"Well, young gentleman," he began, after we
had greeted each other, "and what can I do for
you to-day. No more legal troubles, I hope?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come to you on two errands," I replied.
"In the first place I want to know what you have
done concerning Harveston and the Company?"</p>

<p>"I have received a letter from the former
gentleman this morning," he answered, turning
over some papers on the table as he spoke.
"Let me see, where is it? Ah! here it is! In
it he states that, while he has not the least desire
to damage your reputation, or to prejudice your
career, he cannot retract what he has said, or
withdraw what was entered in the ship's log.
The charge of untruthfulness, he admits, might be
reconsidered, and he is also willing to suppose
that your neglect of the ship might be due to a
certain slackness which was engendered by the
easy-going habits of your late commander. In
conclusion, he begs to assure me that he has
never, at any time, entertained the least feeling
of animosity for yourself, but that, in reporting
the matter to the Company, he merely acted in
the manner that he deemed to be consistent with
his duty."</p>

<p>"A preposterous letter in every sense of the
word," I cried angrily. "Not content with
injuring me, he must endeavour to reflect on
Captain Pomeroy, who is dead. Never mind,
I'll be even with him yet&mdash;the hound."</p>

<p>The old gentleman permitted a dry smile to
appear on his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad at least to observe," he said,
"that you have abandoned your notion of taking
immediate action against him."</p>

<p>"It would be impossible for me to do so, even
if I had any desire that way," I replied. "The
fact is, I am leaving England for South America
on Wednesday next, and don't quite know when
I shall be back. And that brings me to the
second portion of the business upon which I
desire to consult you."</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you have obtained
another situation?" he inquired. "And, pray,
what line of steamships are you now going to
serve?"</p>

<p>"I am not serving any line of steamships," I
replied. "I am going out on private business,
and I want you, if you will be so kind, to take
charge of a certain letter I have written, and
which I desire shall be opened by the person to
whom it is addressed, in the event of my not
returning within a year. One never knows what
may happen in that part of the world to which I
am now going. Here is the letter."</p>

<p>So saying I produced the epistle I had written
on the previous evening, and which was addressed
to my mother and Molly jointly. The
old gentleman took it and turned it over and
over in his hands.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going to get into any<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
mischief," he said. "I mistrust that part of the
world. And now what else is there I can do for
you?"</p>

<p>"I want you," I replied, "to draw up my will.
I have some little property that I should like to
leave to Molly and my mother. It is not very
much, but it would doubtless prove useful, should
anything befall me."</p>

<p>"We will hope that nothing will happen to
you," said the lawyer. "At the same time I
will draw up your will with pleasure. What
have you to leave?"</p>

<p>When the old boy discovered the amount of
my fortune his face betrayed his astonishment.
Knowing that I had not been left anything by my
father, I could see that he was anxious to question
me concerning the manner in which I had
accumulated this amount. Fortunately for my
reputation for truthfulness, however, he repressed
his inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>"It is a very creditable sum for a young man
to have got together," he remarked. "Much
may be done with five thousand pounds. It
may interest you to know that I myself started
with my articles and not a penny more than a
hundred guineas to my name. To-day, however,
I fancy&mdash;but there, I understand that you wish
this amount, in the event of your death, to be
divided equally between your mother and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Molly. And supposing that one survives the
other?"</p>

<p>"In that case the whole amount must pass to
the survivor!"</p>

<p>He promised me that the document should
be drawn up and forwarded to me for my
signature without delay, whereupon I shook
him by the hand and bade him good-bye. My
one thought now was to get back to Falstead
as quickly as possible. I grudged every hour
I spent away from it. Perhaps it was the
dangerous nature of my enterprise that was
accountable for it; at any rate, I know that I
was dreading the leave-taking that was ahead of
me more than I had ever done before. No one
could say what the next few weeks would have
in store for me, and, as it happened, that very
night I was fated to have a dream that was scarcely
calculated to add to my peace of mind.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I was standing in a large
yard, walled in on every side. Some tropical
foliage was to be seen above the walls. At my
feet was a large hole which I knew to be a grave.
A squad of slovenly soldiers, clad in a uniform I
had never before seen, were leaning on their
rifles, some little distance away, watching me,
while their officer consulted his watch. Then he
shut it with a snap and nodded to me. I was
about to throw down the handkerchief I held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
my hand, when there was a cry and Molly
appeared before me. Running towards me, she
threw her arms about my neck. Knowing that at
any moment the men might fire, I tried to put her
aside. But she only clung the tighter. Every
moment I expected to hear the rattle of rifles,
but it seemed an age before it came. Then the
soldiers fired, and Molly and I fell together,
down, down, down, and I awoke with a start, to
find myself sitting up in bed, my face bathed in
perspiration. Never had I had such a dream
before. More than twenty-four hours went by
before I could get the effect it produced out of
my mind. Molly noticed my condition after
breakfast and asked what ailed me.</p>

<p>"Cannot you guess, darling?" I asked, having
no intention of telling her the truth. "Is it
likely that I could be anything but depressed,
when I am leaving you for I cannot say how
long?"</p>

<p>"But you will be in no danger, and you will
come back to me before very long, will you
not?" she said, looking at me seriously, as if
she were afraid I was hiding something from
her.</p>

<p>"Of course, dear," I replied. "Every man,
however, has to take his chance of something
befalling him when he puts to sea. I might go
to the end of the world&mdash;risk my life in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
thousand different ways&mdash;only to return to
England to be knocked down in the Strand by
a runaway cab. I might go to the North Pole
and come back safely, to fall through the ice and
be drowned in the Vicarage pond. You mustn't
be angry with me, dear," I continued, "if I am
a little downcast. Let us try to think of the
day when I shall return to make you my bride.
Oh, how happy we shall be then!"</p>

<p>"Happy indeed," she answered. "God grant
that day may come soon. I shall pray for you
always, Dick, and ask Him to send my darling
back to me, safe and sound."</p>

<p>We walked as far as Welkam Bridge and then
home again across the meadows to lunch. By
the time we reached the house I had somewhat
recovered my spirits&mdash;but they were destined to
fall to zero again before the day was at an end.
It was a sad little party that sat down to dinner
that evening. My mother could scarcely restrain
her tears&mdash;Molly tried to be cheerful and failed
in the attempt; as for myself&mdash;though I joked
on every conceivable subject, save that of foreign
travel&mdash;my heart was heavy as lead, and my
face, I'll be bound, was as solemn as that of an
undertaker's mute. For the reason that I felt it
would be too much for her to leave it until the
last moment, Molly and I bade each other good-bye
that evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning I rose early, breakfasted at seven,
very much in the same state of mind, I should
say, as a man who is about to be led to execution,
and at eight o'clock gave my dear old
mother one last kiss, and left the house with a
lump in my throat that came near to choking me.
I can see my mother's tear-stained face at the
window even now, as I waved my hand to her
before turning the corner of the village street.
Little did I dream then how much I was to
go through before I should see that beloved
countenance again.</p>

<p>When the last house of the village was behind
me, I mended my pace and struck out for Salisbury.
It was a bright morning; the birds sang
in the hedges, the cattle grazed peacefully in the
meadows, indeed, all nature seemed happy but
myself. I turned the corner of the Ridge Farm,
and, passing through the chalk cutting, began
the descent of the hill that, when you have left
the cross roads and the gipsy's grave behind you,
warns you that you are half-way into town. As
everybody who knows the neighbourhood is
aware, there is at the foot a picturesque cottage,
once the residence of the turnpike keeper, and, a
hundred yards or so on the other side again, a
stile, which commences the footpath across the
fields to Mellerton. I was thinking, as I approached
it, of the last time I had walked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
way with Molly, and was wondering how long it
would be before I should do so again, when, as I
drew near the stile, I became aware of a girlish
figure leaning against the rail. My heart gave
a leap within me, and I cried out, "Molly,
can it be you?" Yet it was Molly sure enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, dear," she faltered, as I approached
her, "do not be angry with me. I could not stay
away. I felt that I must see the last of you!"</p>

<p>It was impossible for me to be angry with her,
even though, as she told me later, she had breakfasted
at six o'clock, and had been waiting at the
stile for me since seven. However, I satisfied myself
by promising her a good wigging when I came
home again, and then we set off together. How
short the remainder of that walk seemed, I must
leave you to imagine. It appeared scarcely to
have commenced before we had left the country
and were in the quaint old streets of Salisbury,
making our way towards the railway station.
We must have walked somewhat slowly, for,
when we reached it, I found that I had only five
minutes to spare. Over the parting that took
place when the train put in an appearance I
must draw a veil.</p>

<p>Punctually at half-past eleven the train
steamed into Waterloo and disgorged its
passengers upon the platform. I immediately
engaged a cab and drove direct to Silvestre's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
hotel, where, for upwards of half-an-hour, I was
closeted in close confabulation with him. Then
I bade him good-bye, for it was part of our
arrangement that he should not accompany me
to the ship, and, having done so, returned to my
cab and bade the man drive me to the railway
station, where I was to take the train to the
docks. By three o'clock I was on board, and
endeavouring to convince myself that I was only
a passenger, and not in any way connected with
the working of the vessel. At a quarter to
four we were steaming down the river, and my
one and only adventure had commenced.</p>

<p>How was it destined to end? was the question
I asked myself.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">[Pg 79]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>It was a new experience to me to find myself
at sea as a passenger, to have no watches to keep,
and no round of irksome duties to perform. It
was a pleasant change to be able to turn into one's
bunk at ten o'clock and to enjoy a good night's
rest, after being used to leaving it at midnight
in order to go up and pace a cold and cheerless
bridge for four long hours at a time. I had a
vague premonition that I should be recognized
as soon as I arrived on board. Strangely enough
this proved to be the case, for I had no sooner
set foot on the promenade deck, before a well-known
voice hailed me.</p>

<p>"Hulloa, Dick Helmsworth," it said. "What
on earth brings you aboard this hooker?"</p>

<p>I turned and recognized the speaker as an old
shipmate, who, like myself, had once sailed with
Harveston. But, more fortunate than myself, he
had managed to retain his billet after so doing.
In reply to his question I informed him that I
was proceeding to Barbadoes on private business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and that I profoundly hoped I had abandoned
the sea as a profession. From him I learnt the
names of the various officers of the boat. For
more reasons than one I was glad to hear that
they were unknown to me, and also that there
was only one first-class passenger for Barbadoes.
He proved to be an old French priest, and from
what I saw of him, I gathered that he would not
be likely to remember me, or, indeed, any one
else, when once he had left the vessel.</p>

<p>A good passage down Channel and a smooth
crossing of the Bay carried us well on our
way. We reached Madeira in due course, and
afterwards settled down for the voyage across
the Atlantic. Among other things, I had to
familiarize myself with the character I was about
to portray. To be a rich young Englishman,
with a passion for yachting, would not at first
thought seem a difficult part to play. It was
not as easy, however, as it would appear. In
order that it might come the more naturally to
me, I determined to cultivate a manner while on
board. I accordingly spoke with a somewhat
affected drawl, interlarded my speech with
"Reallies," "Bah Joves," "Don't you know,"
and other exotic flowers of speech, until my old
friend Kirby, the chief officer, found occasion to
remonstrate with me.</p>

<p>"What on earth has come over you, Dick?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
he cried. "You're as affected as a school-girl.
You'll have to come back to sea, my lad, or
you'll be developing into a masher of the worst
type. It's very evident that lying in at night
don't suit you. You ought to be back on the
bridge again, standing your watch like a man."</p>

<p>"Not if I know it," I replied. "I've had
enough of that sort of thing to last me a lifetime.
Wait until you come into a bit of money,
my boy, and then you'll see how nice it feels to
watch others work."</p>

<p>"Egad! I wish I could," he answered. "I'd
never trouble the briny again. Give me a cottage
somewhere in the country, with a bit of garden,
and some fowls to look after, and I wouldn't change
places with the Czar of all the Russias."</p>

<p>Two days before we were due to reach Barbadoes,
I made a resolve. This, in due course, took me
along the alley-way to the barber's shop. As
soon as the passenger whose hair he had been
cutting departed, I seated myself in the vacated
chair, and when the barber asked me what he
could do for me, I put up my hand to my
moustache.</p>

<p>"Take this off," I said.</p>

<p>The man gazed at me in astonishment. My
moustache was a heavy one, and it was plain that
he thought me mad to want to get rid of it.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say, sir, that you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
me to take it off," he remarked, as if he had not
heard aright.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I <i>do</i> mean," I replied.
"I want it out of the way."</p>

<p>He thereupon took up his scissors and began
his work of destruction, but in a half-hearted
fashion. When he had finished I sat up and
looked at myself in the glass. You may believe
me or not, when I tell you that I scarcely
recognized the face I saw there.</p>

<p>"If I were to meet you in the street, my lad,
I should pass you by," I said to myself. Then to
the barber I added: "What a change it makes
in my appearance."</p>

<p>"It makes you look a different man, sir," the
barber replied. "There's not many gentlemen
would have sacrificed a nice moustache like that."</p>

<p>I paid him, and, when I left the shop, went
to my cabin. Once there, I unlocked my trunk,
and took from it a smart yachting cap and a
leather case, containing various articles I had
purchased in London. One of these was an eye-glass,
which, after several attempts, I managed
to fix in my eye. Then, striking an attitude,
I regarded myself in the mirror above the
washstand.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. George Trevelyan," I
muttered. "I'm very pleased to make your
acquaintance."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, bah Jove, that's awfully good of
you to say so," I answered in my assumed
voice. "I hope, bah Jove, we shall be very
good friends for the time that we're destined to
spend together."</p>

<p>"That will only be until we get back to
Barbadoes," Dick Helmsworth replied. "After
that, Mr. George Trevelyan, you can clear out
as soon as you please. From that day forward
I shall hope never to set eyes on you again."</p>

<p>I thereupon placed the eye-glass in its case,
put the cap back in the trunk, and relocked the
latter. After that I went on deck to receive the
chaff I knew would be showered upon me by my
fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>Two days later, that is to say, on the twenty-ninth
of the month, we reached the island of
Barbadoes and came to anchor in the harbour
of Bridgetown. When I had collected my baggage,
I bade my friends on board good-bye and
made my way ashore. I had already carefully
searched the shipping, but I could see no sign
of any yacht, such as I had been led to expect
I should find awaiting me there. I did not
worry myself very much about it, however,
knowing that her captain had been furnished
with my address, and feeling sure that he
would communicate with me as soon as he
arrived. On landing I drove to the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Hotel and engaged rooms in my own name. I
had intended adopting my assumed cognomen
on quitting the ship, but to my dismay I
learnt that some of the passengers had also
come ashore and were due to lunch at my
hotel. To have entered my name as Trevelyan
upon the books, and have been addressed as
Helmsworth in the hearing of the proprietor,
might have sowed the seeds of suspicion in his
mind. And this I was naturally anxious not to
do. Later in the day the passengers returned
to the steamer, and she continued her voyage.
As I watched her pass out of the bay I wondered
whether I should ever see her again. Before it
would be possible for me to do so, many very
strange adventures would in all probability have
happened to me.</p>

<p>On my return to the hotel, I inquired for
the proprietor, who presently came to me in
the verandah.</p>

<p>"I expected to have met a friend here," I said,
"a Mr. Trevelyan. I am given to understand,
however, that he has not yet arrived?"</p>

<p>"There is no one staying in the hotel at
present of that name," he replied. "There
was a Mr. Trevelyan here last year, but, if my
memory serves me, he was a clergyman."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it cannot have been the same
person," I said, with a smile. "By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
should any one happen to call, and inquire
for him, I should be glad if you would give
instructions that he is to see me."</p>

<p>"I will do so with pleasure," the other replied.
"At the same time perhaps I had better reserve
a room for your friend?"</p>

<p>"You need not do that," I answered.
"There is no knowing when he will be here.
It is just possible I may pick him up in
Jamaica."</p>

<p>Having thus put matters on a satisfactory
footing I prepared to wait patiently until news
should reach me from Captain Ferguson. Though
I sat in the verandah of the hotel and carefully
scrutinized every one who entered, I went to
bed that night without seeing any person who
at all answered the description I had been given
of him. I spent the following morning partly
in the verandah of the hotel, and partly searching
the harbour for the yacht. I returned to
lunch, however, without having discovered her.
In the afternoon I went for a short stroll, leaving
word at the hotel that, should any one call to
see me, he or she had better wait, for I should
be back in an hour. When I returned I questioned
the head waiter, but he assured me that
no one had called to see either Mr. Trevelyan
or myself. Once more darkness fell, and once
more after dinner I sat in the verandah smoking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The evening was far advanced, and once
more I was beginning to contemplate turning
in, feeling certain that Ferguson would not put
in an appearance that night, when a short, stout
individual came briskly up the steps and entered
the building. He was dressed entirely in white,
and had a broad-brimmed Panama hat upon his
head. He might have passed for a merchant or
a planter, but something, I cannot say what,
instinctively told me that he belonged to the
seafaring profession. After a few moments he
reappeared again, this time accompanied by the
head waiter.</p>

<p>"This gentleman," the latter began, addressing
me, "wishes to see Mr. Trevelyan. I told
him that we had no one of that name staying at
the hotel, but that you were Mr. Trevelyan's friend."</p>

<p>"That is certainly so," I said. "I presume
you are Captain Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," the other replied, and
when the servant had disappeared, he continued:
"May I ask whom I am addressing?"</p>

<p>"My name is Helmsworth," I answered in a
low voice, at the same time motioning him to
be seated. "A certain gentleman of the name
of Silvestre, however, thinks I had better be
known by the name of the person whom the
waiter informed you had not yet arrived in the
island."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case you are Mr. Trevelyan," he said
in a whisper, drawing his chair a little closer to
mine as he did so, and closely scrutinizing me.
"Perhaps you have something for me?"</p>

<p>"I have a letter," I replied, thinking at the
same time that I had seen his face somewhere
before. "What have you for me?"</p>

<p>"This," he replied laconically, and in his turn
produced a small silver coin, which he handed
to me.</p>

<p>I rose from my chair and carried it down the
verandah as far as the hall door. The light there
enabled me to see that it was stamped with the
name of Equinata. I thereupon returned to the
captain, and handed him the letter Don Guzman
had given me for him.</p>

<p>"And where is the yacht?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"In the harbour," he replied. "We got in
at dark, and she is coaling now as fast as we can
get the stuff aboard. When will you be ready to
start?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you please," I replied. "The
sooner we are out of this place the better for
all people concerned."</p>

<p>"Would nine o'clock to-morrow morning be
convenient to you?"</p>

<p>"It would suit me admirably. How am I to
get my traps aboard?"</p>

<p>"If you will have them sent down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
wharf I will arrange the rest," he answered.
"The boat for Santa Lucia will be in shortly
after daylight, and the hotel folk will naturally
suppose that you have gone aboard her. Of
course you understand, Mr. Helms&mdash;Mr. Trevelyan,
I mean, that in this matter I am acting
under your orders, and that I shall endeavour
to do all in my power to bring the business
upon which we are engaged to a satisfactory
conclusion."</p>

<p>"You quite understand what is required of
me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he answered. "My instructions
have been most complete."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think you will have all your work cut
out for you," he replied. "Don Fernandez is
as sharp as a weasel and as cunning as a fox.
But perhaps it would be better for us to say
no more upon the matter, at least at present.
We can talk it over if we want to, with greater
safety, on board. And now, if you don't mind,
I'll bid you good-night. I've got a lot of
work to get through before we leave to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>We shook hands, and after he had promised
to have a boat ready for me at nine o'clock next
morning, he bade me good-night and left me.</p>

<p>From the little I had seen of him, I liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the look of the man. He had a resolute air
about him, and it struck me that in him I had
found one who was likely to prove himself a
useful ally. But where on earth had I seen
him before? For the life of me I could not
remember. Lighting another cigar, I seated
myself, and once more pondered over the matter.
When the cigar was finished I retired to my
room to fall asleep directly I was in bed, and to
dream that I was abducting the Chairman and
Directors of my old Company, and that I was
flying through the air with them in a balloon
built on the principles of a motor-car.</p>

<p>Next morning I was astir early, had had my
breakfast, had paid my bill, and had seen my
trunks on their way to the wharf, before a
quarter to nine. On my arrival at the water's
side, however, there was no sign of any yacht's
boat. Some distance out I could perceive the
Inter-Colonial mail steamer with a crowd of
boats about her, and a dozen cables or so distant
from her a handsome white yacht, which,
I gathered, was to be my home for the next
few weeks. I had just rewarded the porters,
who had brought my luggage down, and had
sent them about their business, when a neat
gig, pulled by four men and steered by a fifth,
came into view round the end of the jetty.
Pulling up at the steps below me, the coxswain<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
touched his hat and inquired whether he was
addressing Mr. Trevelyan. Upon my answering
in the affirmative, two of his men jumped
ashore, and carried my baggage down to the
boat. I thereupon took my place in the stern
and we set off.</p>

<p>"That, I presume, is the <i>Cynthia</i>, lying astern
of the mail-boat?" I said to the coxswain, as we
pulled out into the harbour.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's the <i>Cynthia</i>," he replied.
"When you get a bit closer, sir, you'll say
she's as fine a craft as you'd see in a long day's
sail."</p>

<p>He certainly spoke the truth. The vessel in
question could scarcely have been less than a
thousand tons. (As a matter of fact that was
her tonnage.) To my thinking, however, she
was somewhat heavily sparred for her size, but
the coxswain hastened to assure me a better
sea-boat could not be found.</p>

<p>Captain Ferguson met me at the gangway,
and saluted me as if I were really owner of the
vessel and not a make-believe, such as I really
was.</p>

<p>"You will find your cabin prepared for you,"
he said. "If you will permit me I'll show you
to it."</p>

<p>Then, going on ahead, he conducted me into
the main companion, and through an elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
saloon to a large and most comfortable cabin,
evidently built and intended for the owner. It
was a gorgeous affair. Indeed, the luxury of
the vessel, what I had seen of it, astonished
me. I had overhauled many yachts in my time,
but had never seen one like this before. She
was as spic and span as if she had only just left
the builder's hands.</p>

<p>When I had seen my baggage arranged, I
ascended to the deck, where I found Captain
Ferguson in the act of getting under weigh.
Ten minutes or so later, our anchor was aboard
and we were steaming slowly out of the harbour.
In an hour the island lay like a black dot upon
the horizon behind us, and a few minutes later
had vanished altogether. I was seated in the
cabin with Captain Ferguson at the time, and
when he rang the bell and ordered the servant
who answered it to bring up a bottle of champagne,
we pledged each other in it, and drank
to the success of our enterprise.</p>

<p>"It's a small world, sir," he said at last, as
he set down his glass, "and few of us really
understand <i>how</i> small it is. I wonder what
you'll say when you hear what I've got to tell
you. I remember once being in Hong Kong.
It was in the wet season, and I was on my way
out to Japan to meet a boat in Nagasaki, that
I was to take over on behalf of the Company I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was then serving. On the evening of my arrival
in Hong Kong I went ashore to dine with some
friends, and didn't start to come off to the mail-boat
until pretty late. When I did I hired a
sampan and told one of the crew where my ship
was. Thinking that he understood, I took my
place under the covered arrangement that those
boats have, and away we went. Perhaps I may
have been a bit drowsy after the festivities of
the evening. I'll not say anything about that,
either way. The fact, however, remains, that
we had not gone very far before I became
conscious that there was something wrong. It
seemed to me as if the tilt, or cover, under
which I was sitting, was coming down upon
me. I sprang to my feet and endeavoured to
push it up, giving a shout as I did so."</p>

<p>All this time I had been listening to him
with ill-concealed impatience. As I have already
remarked, it had struck me on the previous evening
that I had seen the man's face somewhere
before.</p>

<p>"I think I can tell you the rest," I interrupted.
"A ship's boat happened to be passing
at the moment, and, on hearing your shout, she
came alongside and a couple of men in her sprang
aboard the sampan. I was one of those men.
We bowled over the owner of the craft, and
pulled you out from under the cover, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
you were about done for. Good heavens! I
thought I recognized you last night at the hall
door, and now you bring that adventure back to
my mind, I remember you perfectly."</p>

<p>"And I you," he answered. "I've been
puzzling my brains about your face all night.
You had a moustache then, but I should know
you now again. I don't think, Mr. Trevelyan,
you will find me go into this business any the
less warmly for what you did for me that
night."</p>

<p>"You were right when you declared it to be
a small world," I said. "Fancy our meeting
again and on such an errand as this."</p>

<p>I then proceeded to question him concerning
the officers and men under his charge.</p>

<p>"My chief officer," he said, "is a man of the
name of Burgin. He has seen a good deal of
rough-and-tumble work in various parts of the
world, and, as I have satisfactorily proved, can
be thoroughly relied on when it comes to a
pinch. The second is a young fellow of the
name of Brownlow. He took part in the last
Cuban expedition, and had a bit of fighting
afterwards in the Philippines. The crew number
thirty all told, and have been most carefully
selected. I have tested them in every way, and
feel sure they can be reckoned upon to do their
duty. Now perhaps you'd like to have a look<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
round the vessel? You've seen next to nothing
of her yet."</p>

<p>He accordingly conducted me over the yacht
from stem to stern, until I was familiar with
every detail. If I were to pose as a young
Englishman whose hobby was yachting, I could
scarcely have had a finer craft wherewith to
indulge my fancy. She was a Clyde-built vessel
of, as I have already said, exactly a thousand
tons; her length was not far short of two
hundred and fifty feet. Her engine-room was
amidships, and was as perfectly fitted as everything
else. The drawing-room was a model of
beauty, while the saloon was capable of seating
at least fifty persons. The quarters of the officers
and crew left nothing to be desired on the score
of comfort. Only on one question was the
captain at all reticent, and that was concerning
the identity of the yacht's owner. Her papers,
I discovered, were made out in my name, or
rather, I should say, in my assumed name, but
whether she was the property of Silvestre, or of
somebody else, I was never able to ascertain.</p>

<p>Though Silvestre had informed me that, from
the moment I set foot on board, I should be considered
the yacht's owner, I had not attached
any great importance to the remark. I soon
discovered, however, that there was more in it
than I supposed. For instance, when I was told<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that evening that dinner was upon the table, I
made my way to my cabin, prepared myself for
it, and entered the saloon to find that I was
expected to dine in solitary grandeur. Two men-servants
were present to wait upon me, but there
was no sign of the captain.</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Ferguson?" I inquired of
one of the men when I had waited some two or
three minutes for him to put in an appearance.</p>

<p>"He dines in the officers' mess, sir," the man
replied.</p>

<p>Resolving to remedy this state of things on
the morrow, and feeling that it was of no use my
sending for him that night, I proceeded with my
dinner without further remark. Accustomed as
I was to good living on board a mail-boat, I can
only say that, in all my experience, I had never
met with anything like the meal that was served
to me that evening. If Silvestre had given
orders that my comfort was to be studied, he
had certainly been carefully obeyed. When I
rose from the table I went to my cabin, changed
my coat, filled a pipe, and mounted with it to
the bridge. Ferguson met me by the chart-room
door, and expressed the hope that I had been
made comfortable. I told him that the only
fault I had to find was on the score of company,
and went on to say that I expected him for the
future to take his meals with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be out of place for a captain to
dine with his owner until he is invited to do so,"
he said, with a laugh. "However, if you wish it,
I shall be very pleased to do so in the future."</p>

<p>I remember that it was a beautiful night; the
sea was like glass, and the great stars overhead
were reflected in the deep as in a mirror. As I
smoked my pipe I thought of Molly, and wondered
what she was doing at that moment. That
I was a trifle homesick I will not deny. At ten
o'clock Ferguson invited me to his cabin, and
for about an hour we sat there discussing the
business that lay before us. He had never
visited Equinata before, but he was conversant
with the character of the country. Having procured
a chart from a locker, he made me aware
of the whereabouts of the President's palace;
showed me where he thought it would be best
for the yacht to lie, and various other details
that had struck him as being applicable to the
case in hand.</p>

<p>"And now one other question: What do you
know of Fernandez himself?" I inquired, when
he had rolled up the chart and replaced it in the
locker.</p>

<p>"Only what I have heard," he replied. "He is
an exceedingly clever man, and as unscrupulous
as any president who has ruled in South America,
not excluding our friend Silvestre. It is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
certain that if he has the least suspicion of what
we are after, ours is likely to be a short shrift. I
presume you thought the whole business out
well before you embarked upon it?"</p>

<p>I answered to the effect that I had given it
all due consideration, and that whatever chances
there might be I was prepared to take them.
There was one question, however, that I had
been desirous of putting to him ever since I had
been on board, and now that we were alone
together I resolved to ask it, and to risk his
refusal to reply.</p>

<p>"With regard to Don Guzman de Silvestre," I
said, "what do you know of him?"</p>

<p>Somewhat to my surprise he was quite frank
with me.</p>

<p>"I know very little of him," he answered,
"except that I owe my present position to him.
Of one thing, however, I am aware, and that is
the fact that he is not a man to be trifled with."</p>

<p>After a while I bade him good-night, and left
him to go below to my cabin. Before entering the
companion, however, I leant upon the bulwarks
and gazed across the sea. Scarcely a sound broke
the stillness of the night; the monotonous pacing
of the officer of the watch, the look-out's cry,
"All's well," and the throbbing of the engines,
were all that broke the silence. I went over my
talk with Ferguson again. After what he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
said it appeared to me that the task I had undertaken
was an almost hopeless one. One little
mistake and my life would pay the forfeit.
Failure seemed certain, and in that case what
would happen to Molly and my mother? They
would hope against hope, waiting for the man
who would never return. I told myself that I
was a fool ever to have had anything to do
with the business. What was Don Guzman de
Silvestre and his ambition to me? Why should
I risk my life and my dear one's happiness for
the sake of a paltry ten thousand pounds? In
sheer disgust I turned on my heel and went
to my cabin. Whatever my thoughts may have
been on deck, they certainly did not trouble me
very much below. I slept like a top all night,
and when I came on deck next morning I had
well-nigh forgotten my melancholy musings of
the previous evening.</p>

<p>For the next four days our life scarcely varied.
I read and smoked on deck, chatted with Ferguson,
improved my acquaintance with the other
officers, and counted the days until we should
reach our destination. As you may suppose, it was
a welcome moment when the skipper announced
that we were only a matter of ten hours' steaming
from the Republic of Equinata. Next morning
a faint smudge was discernible on the horizon
straight ahead of us; by breakfast-time this had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
taken to itself the appearance of land, and when
I returned to the bridge after my meal, a range
of mountain peaks were plainly to be seen. By
ten o'clock we were near enough to discern the
entrance to the harbour, and by half-past we
were steaming in between the heads, to drop our
anchor in the bay.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">[Pg 100]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>La Gloria, the chief port and capital of the
Republic of Equinata, is charmingly situated on
the west side of an admirably shaped bay, and is
land-locked, save for a distance of about half-a-mile.
It boasts a population numbering upwards
of thirty thousand, of which only some ten or
twelve thousand are white, the remainder being
half-castes, quadroons, mulattoes, and negroes
unadulterated. The city possesses some fine
buildings, notable among which is the Cathedral
of San Pedro, a handsome edifice, though somewhat
damaged by the earthquake of '83. The
Houses of Parliament are also imposing structures,
as befits a land where every man is a
politician, and no boy knows what may be in
store for him. There is also the President's
palace, and, of course, an opera house, and
equally of course a long stretch of barracks,
where the soldiers would seem to spend their
time smoking cigarettes and hatching plots
against their superiors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>As we passed through the Heads and entered
the harbour, it struck me I had never looked
upon a fairer scene. The blue waters of the bay,
the white houses peeping out from amid the
wealth of foliage, and the mountains rising tier
upon tier behind, made up as pretty a picture as
the eye of man could desire to dwell upon. We
had scarcely come to anchor before a boat put off
to us, pulled by four stalwart niggers, and carrying
a much-uniformed official, who sat beside the
coxswain. He proved to be the health officer&mdash;a
voluble little Spaniard, with a magnificent
idea of his own importance. As soon as his boat
was alongside he ran up the ladder to the gangway
with the agility of a monkey, and made his
way to the place where Captain Ferguson was
waiting to receive him. During the years I
had been in the South American trade, I had
managed to pick up a considerable smattering of
Spanish, enough at any rate to make myself
understood by the Dons. I was not nearly so
fluent with it, however, as was Ferguson, who,
I soon discovered, could talk the lingo as well as
any swell of Aragon. As soon as they had
transacted their business, the latter brought the
health officer along to the saloon whither I had
descended, and where I was introduced to him
as the owner of the yacht.</p>

<p>"You possess a most beautiful vessel, se&ntilde;or,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
he said, bowing before me as if he would never
be able to straighten his back again.</p>

<p>"And you a most beautiful harbour and city,"
I replied, resolved not to be outdone in the
matter of compliments.</p>

<p>"Am I to believe that this can be your first
visit to Equinata, se&ntilde;or?" he asked as if in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, my first," I replied in my best Trevelyan
manner. "I can assure you, however,
that I am charmed with it, most charmed."</p>

<p>"Ah, you must wait until you have been
ashore," he continued, "then you will indeed be
surprised. The Plaza, the Almeda, the Opera
House, and the President's palace. Ah!" Here
he paused and gave an airy wave of his hand as
if to signify that, when I should come to view
these wonders, I might indeed describe the city
as being beautiful; until then, however, I could
not pretend to any real notion of its glories.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to make its acquaintance,"
I returned, "and also to pay my respects
to your most illustrious President, who, I hear,
is beloved by all his people."</p>

<p>"Ah, the good President," said the little man,
but without any great enthusiasm. "And his
niece&mdash;the beautiful Se&ntilde;orita Dolores. I raise
my glass to the most beautiful woman in
Equinata." Thereupon, with his eyes turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the deck above, he drank solemnly to the health
of the lady of whose existence I then heard for
the first time.</p>

<p>A little more desultory conversation followed,
in the course of which I managed to extract from
him, in a roundabout way, a quantity of information
of which I stood in need. Then the
little man hoisted himself out of his chair, and
with a regret born of a bottle and a half of
excellent champagne, stated his intention of returning
to the shore once more. Having fired
another salvo of compliments at me, he carried
this plan into effect, and we saw no more of him.
Half-an-hour later the Harbour Master and the
Chief Customs official arrived, drank more champagne,
with which you may be sure I liberally
plied them, smoked a number of cigars, praised
their city, their country, and their excellent
selves, but did nothing in the way of performing
their business, and in their turn departed for the
shore. Then I lunched, spent an hour in meditation
in an easy-chair under the awning, and
then, having ordered a boat, prepared to set off
on a tour of inspection of the capital.</p>

<p>The landing-place at La Gloria is, or was, very
similar to that of most other South American
seaports. That is to say, at some distant date,
harbour works on a very large scale had been
commenced, but for some reason had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
completed. Possibly a Revolution may have been
accountable for the stoppage of the work, or the
President, or Minister of Public Works, may
have decamped with the funds. At any rate all
there was to show for the money voted was one
substantially built wharf, the commencement of
a pier, and a quantity of uncut stone, which still
remained, moss-covered and weather-worn, just
where the contractors had dumped it down.</p>

<p>I landed at the wharf, and immediately dispatched
the boat back to the yacht. Trustworthy
though the crew might be, I had no
desire that they should hang about the sea front
and talk to the inhabitants. Then, leaving the
wharf, I made my way into the town.</p>

<p>It was a picturesque place of the true Central
American type. The Calle de San Pedro, which
cuts the town proper in half, is a handsome
thoroughfare, and contains numerous fine shops,
warehouses, and merchants' offices. Indeed, the
scene in the street on that particular afternoon
was a most bright and animated one, and would
not have discredited Rio or Buenos Ayres. Half-a-mile
or so further on the street in question
enters the Great Square, in which stand the
Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, the Law
Courts, and, more important than all, so far as
I was concerned, the President's palace. The
centre is laid out as a public garden, and possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a band-stand and many fine statues of the
heroes of Equinata in impossible garbs and more
impossible attitudes. Seating myself on a bench
in this garden, I took careful stock of my surroundings.
Opposite me was the President's
palace, with a sentry lounging on either side
of the gates. While I watched the latter were
opened, and a handsome carriage drove in and
pulled up before the massive portico of the
palace. After that the gates were closed once
more.</p>

<p>I do not mind confessing that at this point in
my adventure I was at a loss to know how to
proceed. I might visit the palace and inscribe
my name in the visitors' book, but, so far as
I could see, that would not do very much to
help me. I consulted the card I had brought
with me, and on which was written the name
and address of the man to whom, so Silvestre
had informed me at our last meeting, I was to
look for assistance. His name was Don Jos&eacute; de
Herma&ntilde;os, and his address was No. 13 in the
Calle de San Juan. Before leaving the yacht
I had taken the precaution to make myself
familiar with the quarter in which the street
was situated, and had ascertained that it commenced
at the Houses of Parliament and ran
straight through the western portion of the city,
towards the foot of the mountains. I accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
made my way thither, and having discovered
it, proceeded in search of the house in
which the mysterious Don Jos&eacute; resided, or had
his place of business. Greatly to my surprise it
proved to be a wine merchant's shop, and I
accordingly entered the little square <i>patio</i> and
looked about me. On the left was what was
evidently the office, and in it an old man, engaged
on some mysterious manipulation of an
empty cask. I addressed him in my best
Spanish, but he took no sort of notice of me.
I called to him again with the same result. Then
having satisfied myself that the old fellow was
deaf, I touched him on the shoulder with my
stick. This had the desired effect, for he jumped
quickly round and stared at me in amazement.</p>

<p>A more comical countenance than he possessed
I don't remember ever to have seen. He was
a mulatto, and, if one might judge from his
appearance, some sixty years of age. He asked
me in Spanish who I desired to see, and I replied
to the best of my ability that I was in search
of a gentleman named Herma&ntilde;os. From the
signs the other made I gathered that the latter
was not at home. I endeavoured to question
him concerning him, but the old fellow was
either naturally dense, or, for some reason best
known to himself, pretended not to understand.
In another moment I should have left the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in despair, but, just as I was making up my
mind to do so, the sound of a footstep in the
<i>patio</i> outside attracted my attention. I turned
to find myself face to face with a tall, well-proportioned
stranger, with a black beard and
a pair of bristling moustaches. The old mulatto
forsook his task and handed the other the card I
had given him. He glanced at it, then looked
up from it to me, after which he politely returned
it to me, saying as he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>"You desire to see Don Herma&ntilde;os, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"That is what has brought me here," I answered.</p>

<p>"You come from our neighbours across the
frontier, perhaps?" he continued, still eyeing me
critically.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I have come by sea," I
replied. "I am an Englishman, as you have
doubtless already observed, and my yacht is
anchored in the harbour."</p>

<p>"In that case permit me to welcome you most
heartily to Equinata," he returned, but without
any great show of enthusiasm. "Perhaps you
will accompany me to my private office, where I
shall be pleased indeed to be of any service I can
to you."</p>

<p>I followed him across the <i>patio</i> to a door on
the further side. This he opened, and when
I had passed into the room, he followed my
example and closed it carefully after him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"How am I to know that you are the gentleman
whom I have been led to expect?" he began,
when I had seated myself and he had offered me
a cigar. "As wine of that particular vintage is
very difficult to obtain, you must see yourself
that I have to be most careful that I do not
make the mistake of giving information concerning
it to the wrong person."</p>

<p>I thereupon took my watch from my pocket,
opened the case, and took a small piece of paper&mdash;which
Silvestre had also given me at our last
meeting&mdash;from it. This I handed to the man
before me, who read what was written upon it
very carefully, and then tore it up into tiny
fragments.</p>

<p>"I am quite satisfied," he said, "and now to
arrange the matter you desire." Then, dropping
his voice almost to a whisper, he continued,
"Of course I recognize the fact that you would
not have been chosen for the work had you not
been considered a person most likely to accomplish
it. Nevertheless, I feel sure that you can
have but a very small notion how dangerous it is
likely to prove. The man in question mistrusts
everybody, and should but a breath of suspicion
attach itself to you, you would be in the cartel
to-night, and most probably in your grave to-morrow
morning. Though my opinions have
not changed in a single particular, I am not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
all certain that it is wise of me to mix myself up
in it. However, I don't see exactly in what
way I am to get out of it."</p>

<p>It struck me that the latter portion of his
speech was spoken more to himself than to
me.</p>

<p>"Before we go any further, it would perhaps
be as well that I should convince myself that
you are Don Herma&ntilde;os," I said, for so far I had
had no proof of his identity.</p>

<p>He did not answer me, but crossed to a
writing-table on the other side of the room, and,
unlocking a drawer, took from it a book. Turning
to a certain page, he showed me a series of
portraits of the prominent politicians of Equinata.
One was a likeness of himself, and underneath
was printed his name in full&mdash;Don Jos&eacute; de Herma&ntilde;os,
Minister of Mines. I expressed myself
as being quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"And now," I continued, "will you be good
enough to tell me how you propose to introduce
me to the Pres&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;here he held up his hand
as if in expostulation&mdash;"to the individual whose
acquaintance I am so anxious to make?"</p>

<p>"As you may suppose, I have been thinking
of that," he replied, "and I have come to the
conclusion that it would be better for me not to
be personally concerned in it. As it is, I am
not at all certain in my own mind that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
looks upon me with a favourable eye. I have
a friend, however, with whom he is on terms
of the greatest friendship. Through this friend
I will have you presented. It would be
better in the meantime if you will call at
the palace and inscribe your name in the
visitors' book, according to custom. After that
I will make it my business to see my friend, and
to arrange the matter with him. From that
moment, if you will permit me, I will retire
from the business altogether."</p>

<p>"You do not care about taking the responsibility
of my endeavours, I suppose?" I said.</p>

<p>"Exactly, se&ntilde;or," he answered. "You have
guessed correctly. To be quite frank with you,
I am afraid of being shot. I have seen the
gentleman we are discussing deal with his enemies
on various occasions, and his behaviour impressed
me with a desire to keep my head out of the
lion's mouth."</p>

<p>"May I ask in what capacity you intend
introducing me to your friend?" I went on.
"Is it quite wise, do you think, to import a
third party into the transaction?"</p>

<p>"There will be no third party," he answered.
"There will only be my friend and yourself.
As I understand the situation, you are a rich
Englishman, travelling in our country. You
have given me an order for some wine for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
yacht, and as the leading wine merchant of the
city, and having the reputation of our country at
stake, I am anxious to do my best for you. I
also desire, for the same reason, that you should
enjoy your stay. What could be more natural
than that I should introduce you to a friend who
is also one of our most prominent citizens? You
need not fear, se&ntilde;or, that I shall be foolish enough
to compromise either you or myself."</p>

<p>From what I had so far seen of him I could
quite believe the latter portion of his remark.
If all Silvestre's supporters were of the same
calibre, it struck me that he would experience
some little difficulty in regaining his lost position.
Herma&ntilde;os was certainly as rank a coward as I
had met for many a long day.</p>

<p>"In that case, I will make my way to the
palace now, and write my name in the visitors'
book. But how, and when, shall I hear from
you?"</p>

<p>"I will communicate with you to-night," he
said. "I shall be sending you some wine and
cigars on board, which I hope you will accept,
and I will word the note that accompanies them,
so that you will be able to read between the lines.
It would be as well, I imagine, that we should
not meet again."</p>

<p>From the way he said this I could see he
was as anxious to get rid of me as he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
preserve his incognito. I accordingly thanked
him for his assistance, and bade him farewell.</p>

<p>Recrossing the little <i>patio</i>, I passed into the
street once more, and retraced my steps to the
Great Square. Having reached it, I made
my way through the garden to the President's
palace. The sentries still slouched beside the
gate as I had first seen them. So far as I
could tell, their only object in life was to see
how near sleep they could go without actually
dozing off. Then I entered the palace grounds,
and walked up the drive to the marble portico,
where I entered my name in the book placed
there for that purpose. I had already practised
the new Trevelyan signature, and was by this
time able to write it with something of a flourish.
This momentous act accomplished, I left the
palace and returned to the yacht, feeling that,
although I had not so far made any very important
headway in the conduct of my enterprise,
I had at least set the machinery in motion.</p>

<p>Summoning Ferguson to the smoking-room, I
gave him an account of all that had transpired,
furnishing him at the same time with my opinion
of Don Jos&eacute; de Herma&ntilde;os.</p>

<p>"It only bears out what I said to you the
other night," he observed. "When a man
dabbles in Revolutions he is apt to burn his
fingers. It is very plain that this man Herma&ntilde;os,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to use a popular saying, has taken the
length of the President's foot, and as a natural
consequence he is most anxious to keep out of
its way, lest he should be crushed by it. I don't
know that I altogether blame him. He has
calculated exactly how much he has to gain,
which may not be very much, and he is also
aware that if he fails, he has everything to lose."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to inform me that the
yacht had been an object of considerable interest
to many of the inhabitants of La Gloria that
afternoon. It is doubtful whether such a handsome
craft had ever been seen in those waters
before.</p>

<p>"If only we can get things into proper trim
ashore, they shall have an opportunity of admiring
her even more than they do now, and for
other reasons," I said. "We must have an At
Home on board, and invite the polite society of
the capital."</p>

<p>An hour or so before sundown, the same curious
individual whom I had seen manipulating the
cask in Herma&ntilde;os' office, made his appearance
alongside in a boat. He brought with him a
case of wine and a small box wrapped in paper.
I rewarded him, and dispatched him to the shore
once more. Then returning to the smoking-room
with the smaller parcel in my hand, I
opened it to discover what I had expected I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
should find there, a box of cigars and a note
carefully placed inside. It was not a very long
epistle, and informed me that it gave the
wine merchant the greatest pleasure to comply
with my esteemed instructions, and to forward
me a sample box of the cigars, concerning which
his good friend, General Sagana, had spoken so
highly. Should more be required, his agent
would do himself the honour of waiting upon me
on the following morning to learn my wishes.
That was all!</p>

<p>"That means, of course, that General Sagana
is the agent," I said to myself. "Well, let him
come as soon as he pleases. He will find me
quite ready to receive him."</p>

<p>Next morning I was enjoying the cool breeze
under the bridge awning, when the second mate
came up to inform me that a shore boat was
approaching the accommodation ladder. Rising
from my chair I glanced over the side to discover
that what he had said was correct. A large boat
pulled by six men was approaching the yacht.
In the stern, seated beside the coxswain, was one
of the most curious little specimens of a soldier
one would be likely to find in a day's march.
His height could not have exceeded five feet, but
what he lacked in stature he made up in self-importance.
He was attired in full uniform,
even to the extent of spurs and a sword. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
helmet with plumes was perched upon his head,
while upwards of a dozen crosses decorated his
breast. His face was small and puckered into
a thousand wrinkles; his eyebrows were large,
bushy, and snow-white; while a fierce moustache
of the same colour curled up in corkscrew twists
until it nearly touched his eyes. As soon as the
boat was alongside, he ascended the ladder to
the deck.</p>

<p>"Have I the honour of addressing the most
illustrious Se&ntilde;or <i>Travillion</i>?" he inquired, after
a wrestle with the name, from which he imagined
he had emerged victorious. Upon my answering
in the affirmative, he made me a sweeping bow
that was so irresistibly comic that I had some
difficulty in restraining a smile. Then he continued&mdash;"Se&ntilde;or,
I have the honour to salute
you, and to offer you a hearty welcome to our
beautiful country. Permit me to introduce myself
to you. I am General Sagana, of the army of the
Republic of Equinata."</p>

<p>He said this with as much pride as if his name
would rank in history with those of Napoleon and
Wellington.</p>

<p>"I am deeply honoured by your visit," I
replied. "Allow me to conduct you to a cool
spot under the awning."</p>

<p>An hour later, when he left the yacht, we
were on the best of terms. Moreover, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
arranged that that selfsame afternoon I should
pay a visit of respect to Madame Sagana and her
daughters, who, as I gathered from his words,
existed only until they should have the extreme
felicity of making my acquaintance.</p>

<p>"You must be prepared to stay with us for a
long time," he cried, with a cordiality born of
the best part of two bottles of Perrier-Jouet.
"Ah! believe me, we shall not let you go so
easily. We are hospitable, we of Equinata.
Farewell, then, se&ntilde;or, until we meet this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Then he bowed once more in his best style,
descended to his boat, seated himself in the
stern, and bade his men row him ashore with
all speed, as there was business of importance
toward.</p>

<p>That afternoon, bearing in mind the importance
of the occasion, I once more made a most
careful toilet, and having done so, returned to
the city. Hiring a vehicle of the cab description,
I bade the driver convey me to the residence of
the most illustrious General Sagana. In a whirl
of dust, and accompanied by a swarm of beggar
boys, we set off, and in something less than a
quarter of an hour found ourselves drawn up before
an elegant residence in what might have been
described as the suburbs of the town. After I
had paid and dismissed my charioteer, I rang the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
curious old bell I found hanging on the wall
before me, and when it was answered, followed
the servant into a charming <i>patio</i>, in which a
fountain played, and from thence into a large and
lofty room, where, to my dismay, a considerable
number of people were assembled. It was fortunate
for me that I am not easily abashed.
Had this been the case, I should most probably
have furnished the fashionable world of Equinata
with a poor idea of the behaviour of an Englishman
of wealth and position. At the moment of
my entrance, the little General was paying considerable
attention to a matronly lady who was
so tightly squeezed into her chair that it seemed
she would never be able to move from it again.
Observing me, however, he left her, and hastened
forward to greet me, after which he led me across
the room to present me to his wife and daughters.
The former was a small, though more wizened,
edition of her husband; the latter, however,
were handsome girls of the true Spanish type.
Half-a-dozen other presentations followed, after
which I was at liberty to make myself as agreeable
as circumstances permitted and my knowledge
of the Spanish language would allow. Had
only the General's daughters been present, this
would not have been such a very difficult matter,
for the very few minutes I spent in their company
were sufficient to show me that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
were both past mistresses of the art of flirting.
We were progressing famously, when the door
opened, and the ancient man-servant who had
admitted me, and who was older and even more
wizened than his master or mistress, said something
in a low voice to the General, who immediately
hurried out of the room. A whisper ran
through the company, but what its purport was
I could not discover. All doubt, however, was
presently set at rest when the General returned,
escorting with great pomp a tall, handsome man,
the possessor of a fine head and a singularly
clever face. He saluted my hostess and her
daughters with considerable ceremony, bowed
gravely to the remainder of the company, and
then looked at me, as if wondering who I could
be.</p>

<p>"Permit me, your Excellency," said the
General with one of his flourishes, "to have the
honour of presenting to you Se&ntilde;or Travillion from
England, who, like so many others, has heard of
the glories of Equinata, and has now come to
our country in order that he may see them for
himself."</p>

<p>Long before he had finished his harangue, I
had realized that the man standing before me
was none other than the famous President
Fernandez&mdash;Silvestre's mortal enemy, and the
man I was being paid to abduct.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">[Pg 119]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>As soon as I realized the identity of the man
before me, you may be sure I did my utmost to
appear at my best to him. So much, I knew,
depended on his first impression.</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly pleased to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Trevelyan," said the President,
in a voice that struck me as being distinctly
pleasant. "I fancy I saw your yacht from a
distance this afternoon. She is a handsome craft,
and, if I am not mistaken, was built on the
Clyde. Am I right in my conjecture?"</p>

<p>For a moment I felt inclined to ask myself
how it was this man was able to discriminate
between a boat built on the Thames and another
built on the Clyde. I subdued the inclination,
however, and fell back upon my Trevelyan
manner.</p>

<p>"Quite right," I answered. "She hails from
the Clyde, and, like most boats launched on that
river, she is a credit to her builders. I don't
know that I have ever met with a better. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
hope I may be able to induce your Excellency to
pay her a visit, in order that you may inspect
her for yourself."</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure to do so," he
answered, and when he had conversed with me
for a few moments longer, he left me in order to
pay his respects to a lady at the further end of
the room. I was not sorry for this, as it gave
me an opportunity of observing him a little more
closely. He was certainly a remarkable-looking
man, and each time I glanced at him the conclusion
was more forcibly borne upon me that he
was one with whom it would be better to be
on friendly terms than anything else. Although
there was an apparent kindliness in his manner,
one could not help feeling that it was only the
velvet glove masking the iron hand concealed
below.</p>

<p>He remained in the room for upwards of half-an-hour
and then took his departure, not, however,
until he had crossed to me once more and
had repeated his desire to visit the yacht, in
order that he might inspect her more closely.</p>

<p>"As I said just now, I shall be delighted to
show her to you," I hastened to reply, and thereupon
suggested that he should breakfast with me
on board the next day, and that with his permission
I would include General Sagana and his
family in the invitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are most hospitable, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan,"
he answered, "and if you will allow me I will
also bring my niece, the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores de
Perera. I am sure she will be most pleased to
make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I shall be more than honoured," I replied, in
my best manner, feeling that at last I was making
real headway. "Would eleven o'clock suit
your Excellency's convenience?"</p>

<p>"Admirably," he returned. "Let us then say
<i>au revoir</i> until eleven o'clock to-morrow."</p>

<p>I promised that a boat should meet them at
the wharf, and then bowing to the ladies, and
accompanied by General Sagana, he left the
room. When the General returned he complimented
me warmly upon the success I had made
with the President.</p>

<p>"A most remarkable man, Se&ntilde;or Travillion,"
he continued, twirling his enormous moustaches,
"the most remarkable man Equinata has yet
produced. His career has, indeed, been an extraordinary
one in every way."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" I answered, with an endeavour to
conceal the interest I was taking in what he said.
"May I ask whom he succeeded?"</p>

<p>For a moment the situation possessed a flavour
of embarrassment. I was not aware that the
General had been one of Silvestre's principal
adherents, and that it was only when he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the fact that affairs were not as they should
be with his master that he had transferred his
allegiance to the stronger party.</p>

<p>"His predecessor was a certain Don Guzman
de Silvestre," the old gentleman replied, but in a
tone that suggested two things to me; first, that
he was not aware of my connection with the man
in question, and secondly, that the subject was a
decidedly distasteful one to him. Realizing this
I did not attempt to pursue it further.</p>

<p>Having formally invited my hostess and host
and their daughters to my little <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> on the
following day, I bade them farewell and took my
departure. It was evident that my visit had
been appreciated, and that some importance was
attached to it, for I found the General's private
carriage waiting outside to convey me back to
the wharf. I was careful to thank him for the
courtesy he had extended to me, and then drove
off.</p>

<p>When I retired to rest that night, it was with
the feeling that my day had not been altogether
wasted. Behind it, however, was a decided impression
that President Fernandez was by no
means the sort of man to be caught napping,
and that, if I wished to trap him, it would be
necessary for me to have all my wits about me.
Moreover, I fancied that when I <i>did</i> catch him,
I should find him a somewhat difficult captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to tame. As is very often the case in such
matters, one apparently inconsequent remark of
his haunted me more than anything else that
had fallen from his lips. Why had he declared
the yacht to be a Clyde-built boat? Was it
only a statement made haphazard, or had he
some previous knowledge of the craft in question?
The mere thought that he might know
anything of her past made me anxious beyond
measure. The possibilities were that he did not,
but the fact that he might have an inkling
of my intention was sufficient to prevent me
from sleeping and to cause me to tumble and
toss in my bed, hour after hour, endeavouring to
find some satisfactory solution to the problem.
"I have seen what he can do to those who
offend him," Herma&ntilde;os had said to me,
"and I confess the picture did not please me."
At the same time I could not believe that it was
possible that the President had any idea of the
real reason of my presence in Equinata. The
secret had been so jealously guarded that it could
not have leaked out. These thoughts, however,
did not prevent me from looking forward with
the greatest possible interest to the festivity of
the morrow. Immediately on my arrival on
board, I called Ferguson to a consultation. He
forthwith interviewed the chief cook, and the
result was the preparation of a repast that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
promised to equal anything ever seen in Equinata
before.</p>

<p>As you may suppose, the following morning
was a busy one with us. The arrangements
were most elaborate. Flowers were procured
from the shore, and with them the saloons were
decorated. A string band was engaged to play
on the bridge during the repast, and in the
President's honour the yacht was hung with
bunting.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour before my guests were due to
arrive, I descended to my cabin and made my
toilet. I had scarcely returned to the deck
before I was informed by the chief mate, who
was on the look-out, that the boats we expected
were putting off from the shore. Ferguson stood
beside me and watched them come alongside.
Out of compliment to the President he had
caused the flag of Equinata to be hoisted, and
had drawn up a Guard of Honour from the crew
on either side of the gangway. The first boat
to come alongside contained the President, his
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, and a lady, whom I argued must
be none other than his niece, the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores
de Perera. The President was the first to set
foot upon the deck, and, as he did so, the band
struck up the National Air of Equinata. His
Excellency shook me warmly by the hand, and
then, turning to the lady who accompanied him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
presented me to her. I have met some very
beautiful women in my time, but I am doubtful
whether I have ever seen one who could compare
with the lady I then had before me. She was
slightly above the middle height, with raven hair
and dark flashing eyes, and carried herself with
the grace that is so characteristic of her nationality.
Her manner towards me was distinctly
cordial, and under its influence I began to think
that our luncheon was not destined to be as dull
an affair as I had feared it might be. I escorted
them to a cool spot under the awning, and then
prepared to receive my other guests. Upon their
arrival, we proceeded to the saloon for lunch.
That the President was impressed, I could
plainly see. He paid me many compliments
upon the beauty of the yacht, and vowed that,
when times improved in Equinata, he would
have just such another built for his own private
use.</p>

<p>"How I envy you your lot, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan!"
remarked the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores, when we had
seated ourselves at the table, and as she said it,
she threw a beaming glance at me. "How
beautiful it must be to skim over the seas like
a bird, to be always seeing new countries, and
receiving new impressions. Yours must be an
ideal life, if ever there were one."</p>

<p>"I fear you have omitted to take into your<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
calculations the existence of Custom House
officials, the engagement of crews, and the fact
that a yacht, however beautiful, needs coaling, in
order to be able to properly perform her functions.
There are also storms to mar one's pleasure,
Port Dues, Harbour Regulations, Quarantine,
and a thousand and one other little matters that,
though not important in themselves, are, nevertheless,
sufficient to play the part of crumpled
rose-leaves in your bed of happiness."</p>

<p>"But in these seas you have all smooth sailing.
You came here from&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She asked the question so innocently that I
felt sure it was without any sinister intention.</p>

<p>"From Havana to Key West, and thence to
Jamaica, Barbadoes, and so to Equinata!"</p>

<p>"And your plans after leaving here?"</p>

<p>"I have scarcely formed any plans yet," I
answered, and then I added with a fair amount
of truth, "You see, Se&ntilde;orita, it all depends upon
circumstances. I may go on to Rio, thence to
Buenos Ayres, and perhaps round the Horn to
the Pacific Islands, or I may return to England
at once."</p>

<p>"While we remain on here leading our humdrum
life," said the President, toying with his
champagne glass as he spoke, "and ending the year
almost as we began it, seeing few strangers and
interested only in our own little mediocre affairs."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear your Excellency must speak ironically,"
I said. "What grander or more interesting
occupation can there be in the world, than the
work of building up a new country, a country
which may ultimately take its place among the
greatest of the earth? While I am fluttering
like a butterfly from place to place, you are
guiding, helping, and benefiting your fellow-man,
and through him the entire human race."</p>

<p>"You are an idealist, I perceive, Se&ntilde;or
Trevelyan," the President returned, with one of
his peculiar smiles. "Unfortunately for your
theory, my fellow-man does not always wish to
be benefited, as your words would lead one to
suppose. To my thinking he is very like that
noble animal, the horse, who, while being capable
of great things, must first learn the principles of
subjection. What say you, General Sagana?"</p>

<p>"I agree with your Excellency," replied the
General with some little embarrassment, though
why he should have felt it I could not at the
time understand.</p>

<p>I turned to the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores.</p>

<p>"You are deeply interested in politics, of
course, Se&ntilde;orita?" I said, as innocently as I
knew how.</p>

<p>"No, I do not mind admitting that I take no
sort of interest in politics," she answered. "I
find it better for many reasons not to do so. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
long as I am not publicly insulted in the streets,
and the mob do not attempt to shoot my uncle,
or to come to the palace and break our windows,
I am content to let whichever party pleases hold
the reins of power. But there, I feel sure,
Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, you did not come to Equinata
to talk politics. We must discover a way of
amusing you, and of making your time pass
pleasantly while you are with us, without that!"</p>

<p>As she said this, she glanced down the table
at the two daughters of General Sagana, who
returned her smile with a look that said as plainly
as any words could speak, that if they were given
the opportunity, they would take care that my
time was spent as pleasantly as possible.</p>

<p>All things taken into consideration, my little
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> was a decided success, and the affability
of the President, when the ladies had withdrawn,
helped to confirm me in this opinion. Nothing
could have exceeded his geniality. He narrated
several amusing incidents connected with his
past life, and once even unbent so far as to comment
on a certain act connected with the reign
of his predecessor.</p>

<p>"Silvestre was a clever man; a very clever
man," he said; "but, as events proved, entirely
wanting in a proper appreciation of his position.
Had he used his opportunities as he might have
done, he would, in all probability, be occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the position he held then and which I hold
to-day."</p>

<p>"And may I ask what has become of him?" I
inquired, not without some curiosity as to what
his answer would be.</p>

<p>The President, however, shook his head.</p>

<p>"No one seems to have any idea where he is,"
he said. "After the last crisis he disappeared
from Equinata, but where he went I cannot tell
you. Very probably he is dead. Men of his
calibre do not, as a rule, make old bones."</p>

<p>His manner was so open, his speech so frank,
that my suspicions that he was aware of my
errand in his capital were fast dying away.</p>

<p>Later on we left the saloon and joined the
ladies on deck. A cool wind was blowing, and it
was very pleasant under the awnings. After
half-an-hour's conversation, followed by an inspection
of the yacht, the President declared his
intention of returning to the shore. The boats
were accordingly ordered alongside, whereupon,
having thanked me for my hospitality, the
President and the Se&ntilde;orita, attended by their
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, the latter a great lady-killer, took
their departure. General Sagana and his party
followed suit a little later, and then I was free
to discuss the success of our entertainment with
Ferguson.</p>

<p>"If all goes on as it is doing now," I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
lighting a fresh cigar, and handing my case to
him, "it should not prove a very difficult matter
to inveigle him on board to dinner some night,
when we might settle the affair once and for all."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the chances are a hundred to
one that, if he came, he would bring an <i>aide</i> with
him, as he did to-day. What should we do
then?"</p>

<p>"Take the <i>aide</i> to the island with us," I
replied promptly. "One more prisoner would
make little or no difference to Silvestre."</p>

<p>Next morning I was the recipient of an invitation
from the President to dine at the palace on
the Thursday following. Needless to say, I
hastened to accept, and in due course presented
myself at his Excellency's magnificent abode.
I was met in the hall by the <i>aide-de-camp</i> who
had breakfasted with us on board the yacht, and
by him was conducted to the great drawing-room
where the President and his niece were
receiving their guests. Some thirty or forty
people were present, among the number being
General Sagana and Madame, and their two fair
daughters, who welcomed me like old friends.
The President took the General's wife in to dinner,
while, for some reason best known to them, I was
permitted the honour of escorting the Se&ntilde;orita.</p>

<p>"So you have not grown tired of Equinata
yet, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan?" said my fair companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as we made our way in our turn along the stately
hall in the direction of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I grow more charmed with
it every day," I replied. "Who could help
liking it, when its citizens are so hospitable to
strangers?"</p>

<p>"Before you praise us, remember that you set
us a charming example," she continued. "It
will be long before I forget the pleasant morning
we spent on board your yacht. I can assure you
that my uncle also looks back on it with the
greatest pleasure."</p>

<p>"I trust it may not be the last time he will
visit her," I answered, with more truth than is
usually attachable to an idle compliment.</p>

<p>The room in which we dined was a magnificent
apartment, furnished with a grandeur that gave
it an almost regal dignity. The President's <i>chef</i>
was evidently a treasure, for the dinner could
scarcely have been excelled. During its progress
the President addressed himself on several occasions
to me, and invited me to accompany him
on a visit to some celebrated copper mines in the
neighbourhood, also to a review of the troops
which was to take place in the Great Square in a
week's time. As may be supposed, I was quick
to accept both invitations.</p>

<p>"And at the end of the week there is to be
a grand ball at the Opera House," the Se&ntilde;orita<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
continued, when her uncle had finished speaking.
"It is in aid of the convent of the Little Sisters
of the Poor, and is one of our recognized gaieties
of the year. I wonder if we shall be able to
persuade you to be present?"</p>

<p>"I shall be more than delighted," I replied.
"That is, of course, provided I am not compelled
to leave Equinata in the meantime."</p>

<p>"You must not leave us too soon," she said,
and then paused and examined her plate attentively.
I was about to answer her, when her
attention was attracted by her neighbour on her
right, and I was accordingly left to my own
thoughts.</p>

<p>I looked down the long table, glittering with
glass and plate, and as I did so, I endeavoured
to apprize the value of my extraordinary position.
Who at that board could have guessed the errand
in Equinata of the man whom, doubtless, so
many of them envied for his wealth and for his
magnificent floating home? I could not help
wondering what my own feelings would have
been had I known only three months or so
before, when I was standing watch as a mail-boat
officer, that in a few short weeks I should be the
honoured guest of the President of the Republic
of Equinata, and the presumptive owner of a
yacht valued at upwards of a hundred thousand
pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked across the room and examined the
pictures hanging upon the walls. That exactly
opposite me riveted my attention. I felt that
I could not be mistaken as to the likeness. It
was the portrait of Don Guzman de Silvestre,
and the artist had managed to depict him to the
life. How it called me back to other days! As
I looked at it, I seemed to be sitting in the old
inn garden at Falstead, listening to his instructions
for the campaign, and wondering how long
Molly would be at the choir practice.</p>

<p>"You have suddenly become very silent, Se&ntilde;or
Trevelyan," said the Se&ntilde;orita, rousing me from
my reverie.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that I shall often look back
with pleasure upon this evening," I replied.</p>

<p>The look she gave me would probably have
encouraged many men to embark on a course
of the maddest flirtation. I, however, was
adamant.</p>

<p>"In reality," she said, "I suppose you are
like all the other visitors we have, and, as soon
as you are away from Equinata, you will forget
us altogether."</p>

<p>"I assure you I shall never forget your
beautiful city as long as I live," I answered, and
with more truth than she imagined.</p>

<p>She threw a quick glance at me and then,
looking down the dinner-table, gave the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to the ladies to rise. I must confess here that
the Se&ntilde;orita interested me very strangely. At
first I had thought her merely a very beautiful
woman, well fitted by nature to perform the
difficult task asked of her; it was not long,
however, before I came to have a somewhat
better understanding of her real abilities. In
what light I regard her now, you will be able to
realize for yourself when you have read my story.</p>

<p>As had been arranged, three days after the
dinner I have just described, I accompanied the
President and a considerable party to the famous
copper mines in the mountain range that began
behind the city and extended well-nigh to the
further limit of the Republic. We were only
absent three days, yet in that short space of
time I was permitted an opportunity of
studying the real character and personality of
Equinata's ruler more closely than I had yet
done. At first I must confess I had been
prepared to dislike him, but little by little, so
gradually indeed that I scarcely noticed the
change, I found that he was managing to overcome
my prejudices. Under the influence of
these new impressions I also began to see my
own part of the business in a new light. From
what Silvestre had said to me, I had up to that
time regarded him as a traitor to his friends, and
as a tyrant and enemy to his country. I now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
discovered that he was neither the one nor the
other. He ruled according to his lights, and if
he held his people in an iron grip, it was for the
good and sufficient reason that he knew their
character, and the sort of government they
required. My own position, when I came to
overhaul it properly, I discovered to be by no
means edifying. I accepted his hospitality and
his kindnesses, yet I was only waiting my chance
to prove myself a traitor of the worst kind. I
was posing as his friend, yet at the same time
was preparing to prove myself his worst enemy.
Such thoughts as these kept me company by day
and night, and made me regard myself with a
contempt such as I had never dreamed of before.
And yet I knew that, at any hazard, I must
go through with it. Had I not taken Silvestre's
money and pledged myself to serve him? Therefore
I could not draw back.</p>

<p>On our return to the city from the mountains,
I was present at the review of the troops in the
Great Square, and witnessed the redoubtable army
of Equinata, headed by General Sagana, as you
may suppose in the fullest of full uniforms, march
by and salute its chief. That ceremony over, I
returned to the yacht to while away the hours
as best I could until it should be time to dress
for the great ball that was to take place at the
Opera House that evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Having rigged myself out for the occasion, I
was rowed ashore, and, as I had plenty of time
to spare, I determined to walk to the Great
Square in preference to taking a cab. To do
this it was necessary for me to pass a certain
fashionable <i>caf&eacute;</i>, whose little tables decorated the
broad pavement outside. At one of these tables
two men were seated, playing dominoes as they
sipped their coffee. One of them looked up at
me as I passed. As my eyes fell on his face
I gave a start, for I recognized him instantly
as a well-known Rio merchant, who had made
several voyages with me in the old <i>Pernambuco</i>,
and with whom I had been on the most friendly
terms. He stared at me as if he thought he
ought to know my face, but, I suppose on account
of the absence of my moustache, could not quite
remember where he had seen it last.</p>

<p>I hurried on, with my heart in my mouth, as
the saying has it, but I had not gone very far
ere I heard some one bustling after me. A few
seconds later a hand was laid upon my arm,
and I turned to find the individual I had seen
seated at the table standing before me.</p>

<p>"Ten t'ousand pardons, se&ntilde;or," he began
in English, "but am I mistaken if I say your
name is 'Elmsworth?"</p>

<p>I had to make up my mind.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're making some little mistake,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
I replied, and then added what was
worse than a lie, that is to say, a half-truth, "I
know no one of the name of 'Elmsworth."</p>

<p>"Den I must beg of you ten t'ousand more
bardons," he continued. "I t'ought you vas one
of mine old vriends dot I vas at sea mit. Forgive
me dat I interrupt you in your valk."</p>

<p>I willingly forgave him and passed on.</p>

<p>The question that kept me company for the
rest of the evening was&mdash;Had my assurance
satisfied him? If not, what would he be likely
to do?</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">[Pg 138]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>So long as I may live I shall never forget the
ball at which I was present that night. The
scene was gay beyond description. All the Rank
and Fashion of La Gloria, and one might almost
say of Equinata, were assembled there. When
the dancing had been in progress for some time,
the President and the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores put in an
appearance and were received by the committee
to the strains of the National Air. I must
confess that Fernandez made a most imposing
figure, with his broad ribbon of the Order of La
Gloria, and his wealth of foreign decorations.
As for his companion, it would be difficult for
a mere male mortal to find words in which to
describe the picture she presented. As soon as
it was permissible I crossed the room to her
and humbly asked her for a dance. She was
graciously pleased to give me one, and presently
we found ourselves circling round the room
together to the music of a long swinging waltz,
excellently played. Afterwards I escorted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
from the ball-room into the balcony. It was a
lovely night, and so still, that in the pauses of
the music the sound of the waves upon the
beach could be distinctly heard, though more
than a mile away. I procured my companion's
mantilla for her, with which she draped her head
and neck, with characteristic grace. Never, I
am inclined to believe, had she looked lovelier
than she did at that moment, and when she
leant upon the balustrading of the balcony, and
looked across the city towards the mountains,
behind which the moon was rising, I vowed
that I had never beheld a fairer picture. Few
men could have stood beside her then and not
have felt the fascination of her presence.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," she said meditatively, in
a voice that was as low and musical as the deep
notes of a guitar, "what a strange thing is
life! You and I stand here together now.
Out of the infinite you hold my attention for
minutes that never can be recalled. Later we
shall separate, and then you will go your way,
and I shall go mine. In all probability we shall
never meet again&mdash;yet through Eternity our
destinies will be linked, like the strands of a
rope, by the remembrance of a few minutes'
conversation on a certain moonlight night in
Equinata."</p>

<p>I must confess that this sudden seriousness on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
her part puzzled me considerably. A moment
before she had been all gaiety, a few seconds
later she was gravity personified. The change
was so instantaneous that I found it difficult to
follow her.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must be very obtuse," I
stammered, "but I cannot say that I have quite
caught your meaning."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I know it myself," she
replied. "The beauty of the night has taken
hold of me. The rising of the moon always has
a curious effect upon me. I am afraid you will
think me very absurd, but people say I have
a strange way of looking at things. I was
thinking of our life. Consider for a moment
how much we are governed by Chance. We
meet some one we like, some one whom we
believe might prove a good friend if ever occasion
should arise. He, or she, crosses our path, tarries
perhaps for a moment with us, and then vanishes,
never to be seen by us again."</p>

<p>"But we have the consolation of recollection
left us," I replied, more impressed than ever by
her curious mood. "Every day we put away
impressions in memory's store-house&mdash;mental
photographs, may I call them&mdash;which will conjure
up the Past for us in fifty years' time if need
be. Think of the impression I am receiving at
this moment. It will never be effaced. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
scent of the orange blossoms, the glorious moonlight,
the music of the ball-room yonder, and you
leaning upon the balustrading looking down
upon the sleeping city. The picture will still be
with me even though I have the misfortune to be
many thousand miles from La Gloria. In fifty
years' time I may be in an English village, in a
Chinese seaport, or on the South African Karroo;
then the shimmer of the moonlight on a leaf&mdash;a
chance strain of music&mdash;even a piece of black
lace, like that of your mantilla&mdash;will be sufficient
to bring the whole scene before my mind's
eye. In a flash I shall be transported to this
balcony, and you will be standing beside me
once more."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that she gave a little shiver
as I said this.</p>

<p>"If your mental photographs are to be so
vivid," she continued, "what a sorry figure I
shall cut in them, if through all time I continue
to talk as I have been doing to-night." Then
changing her manner, she went on, "I fear you
will soon grow tired of Equinata."</p>

<p>"That could never be," I replied. "I only
wish it were in my power to stay longer."</p>

<p>"When do you think it will be necessary for
you to leave?" she inquired, as if the question
were one of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say," I answered. "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
afraid, however, it will not be many more
days. I have received information concerning
some rather important business that may possibly
necessitate my leaving for Europe almost
immediately."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that," she said meditatively.
"We had looked forward to enjoying
the pleasure of your society for some time to
come."</p>

<p>She spoke as if I were an old friend whom she
feared to lose. Had a stranger been present, he
or she would have found it difficult to believe
that a fortnight before we had never set eyes on
each other. There are many men in the world
who, had they been in my place, would doubtless
have been charmed, and perhaps more than
charmed, by the interest she displayed in my
doings. She was a vastly pretty woman, dangerously
pretty in fact, but even her tender interest
in my affairs was not sufficient to shake my
equilibrium. Ten minutes or so later we returned
to the ball-room, and I surrendered her
to the partner who came to claim her. Having
done so, I was walking towards the further end
of the room, when the President accosted me.
He was in a most affable mood, and was evidently
disposed for a chat.</p>

<p>"You do not appear to be dancing very much,
Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," he said, dropping into English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
as was his wont when we were alone together.
"Is it possible you feel inclined for a cigar?"</p>

<p>"I am more than inclined," I replied, "I am
pining for one. I never was much of a dancing
man. The hard sort of life I have been compelled
to lead has not permitted me much opportunity
for practising that graceful art."</p>

<p>The words had no sooner escaped my lips than
I realized what a slip I had made. So far as he
was aware, I was, to all intents and purposes, a
rich young Englishman, and should be without
a care in the world. It would therefore seem
to him strange that I should not have had
much chance of perfecting my knowledge of
the terpsichorean art.</p>

<p>"I mean to say," I went on, as we made our
way across the grand lobby to the smoking-room,
"that after I left school, I was for some time
abroad, and&mdash;well, the fact of the matter is, I
never laid myself out very much for ladies'
society."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he replied gravely.
"Like myself, you prefer to look for your amusements
in other directions. Your passion for the
sea I can quite appreciate, but I think, were I in
your place, I should prefer a somewhat larger
craft than your yacht. A mail-boat, for instance,
such as the <i>Pernambuco</i>&mdash;or the <i>Amantillado</i>
would come somewhat nearer the mark."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable in what he said,
and his voice never for a second rose above its
customary pitch. Nevertheless, I looked at him
in overwhelming astonishment. It seemed to
me his words were spoken with a deliberate
intent, and were meant to have a definite value
placed upon them. It was not the first time I
had had the impression forced upon me, and it
was not a pleasant one, I can assure you, that he
had become aware of the real reason for my
presence in Equinata. I hastened to abandon
the subject of the sea, and directed the conversation
into another channel. The result,
however, was very much the same. We thereupon
discussed the possibilities of a European
war, which at that moment seemed not improbable.</p>

<p>"Power," he returned, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of a remark
of mine, "is in my opinion precisely a question
of temperament. Your London crowd is well
trained and will stand what would drive a
Neapolitan or a French mob to violence. Such
speeches are delivered in your parks on Sundays
as would prove in these latitudes as intoxicating
as brandy. I have known a Revolution started
by an ill-timed jest, a city wrecked, and a
thousand lives lost in consequence. Talking of
Revolutions, have you ever had the misfortune
to be called upon to take part in one?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more my suspicions were aroused.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no!" I cried. "What makes
you ask me such a question? Do I look like the
sort of person who would be likely to have to do
with such affairs?"</p>

<p>He glanced at me for a moment over the top
of the cigar which he had taken from his mouth
and was holding between his long slim fingers,
as if to enjoy the beautiful aroma.</p>

<p>"I was merely venturing an inquiry," he
continued, in the same quiet fashion as before.
"If you have not, you should try the experiment.
Believe me, there is a very fair amount
of excitement to be got out of it, particularly
if you have not the good fortune to be on the
winning side. You have met Don Guzman de
Silvestre, of course?"</p>

<p>"Don Guzman de who?" I asked, as if I had
not quite caught the name.</p>

<p>"My predecessor," the President replied. "I
thought that probably you might have come
across him in your travels. He knocks about
the Continent a good deal, and I am told he
is well known at the various ports at which the
mail-boats touch."</p>

<p>The situation was momentarily getting beyond
me. I felt that I could not stand much more
of it. He had referred to the <i>Pernambuco</i>, and
had recommended me to try my hand at a Revolution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
he had mentioned Don Guzman de Silvestre,
and now he was speaking of the ports at which
the South American mail-boats call, and implying
that I was familiar with them. What did it all
mean? Was it only a matter of chance, or was
he aware of my identity, and only biding his
time to rise and upset all my calculations? I
think you will agree with me in saying that it
was not a pleasant position for a man to be
placed in!</p>

<p>"I remember," he went on, "on one occasion
smoking a cigar with Don Guzman de Silvestre
in this very balcony&mdash;he was sitting exactly
where you are now. Though he thought I was
not aware of it, I happened to know that he was
at that time hatching a plot that he hoped would
upset my calculations, turn me out of my palace,
and make him President in my stead. He had
been laying his plans for months, and was quite
sure that they would succeed!"</p>

<p>"And the result?"</p>

<p>"The result was that it failed. If he had not
managed to escape when he did, I am afraid his
life would have paid the forfeit. In spite of the
advice I gave you just now, interference in
Revolutions in Equinata is not an amusement I
should recommend to every one."</p>

<p>"I trust I may never be called upon to try
it," I replied fervently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope you will not," he returned, without
looking at me. "It's an unprofitable speculation
unless you are certain of your cards. The
strongest, of course, wins, and the loser generally
goes to the wall."</p>

<p>I thought I understood to what wall he referred.</p>

<p>A few moments' silence followed his last
speech. The President was the first to break it
by referring to what he hoped would be the
future of his country. It was evident that he
firmly believed in it and its capabilities. Then,
rising from his chair, he bade me "good-night"
with an abruptness that was almost disconcerting.</p>

<p>When he had gone, and I had finished my
cigar, I returned to the ball-room in time
to meet the Presidential party as they were
leaving.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," said the
se&ntilde;orita. "The Little Sisters are indebted to
you for your most generous contribution. In
their name I thank you."</p>

<p>"And I am equally indebted to them for the
pleasure I have been permitted to enjoy this
evening," I replied.</p>

<p>She bowed to me, and passed on, on her uncle's
arm, towards the entrance. When they had
departed I obtained my hat and cloak, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
my turn left the building. During the last ten
minutes my spirits had been dropping down
and down until they reached zero. Never since
I had consented to Don Guzman's plan had my
business in Equinata seemed so hazardous or
indeed so despicable to me. I felt that I would
have given anything never to have set eyes on
my tempter, or to have listened to his invidious
proposal. However, I am not going to moralize.
I've my story to tell, and tell it I must, and in
as few words as possible.</p>

<p>When I left the Opera House, the moon was
sailing in a cloudless sky, and, in consequence,
the streets were almost as light as day. It
was a little after midnight, and I had not
ordered the boat to meet me at the wharf
until one o'clock. I had therefore plenty of
time at my disposal. As I passed out of the
Great Square and entered the Calle de San Pedro,
the cathedral clock chimed the quarter past the
hour. I strolled leisurely along, so that it was
half-past by the time I reached the wharf. Then
I lighted another cigar, and, seating myself on
a stone block, prepared to await the arrival of
the boat. I had perhaps been seated there ten
minutes, when, suddenly, and before I could do
anything to protect myself, a bag or cloth, I
could not tell which, was thrown over my head,
and my arms were pinioned from behind. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a voice said in Spanish, "Lift him up, and bring
him along. There's not a moment to lose."
Thereupon a man took hold of my shoulders and
another my legs, and I felt myself being carried
along, though in what direction I could not of
course tell. A few seconds later, however, I was
dumped down on the wooden floor of what was
evidently a cart. The crack of a whip followed,
and we were off at a brisk pace somewhere&mdash;but
where? The bag by this time was coming near to
stifling me. It had been pulled so tight round my
head that it was only with the greatest difficulty
I could breathe. Eventually, I suppose, I must
have lost consciousness, for I have no recollection
of anything that happened until I opened my
eyes to find myself lying on the floor of a small,
bare room, through the grated windows of which
the moonlight was streaming in. Thank goodness,
the bag was gone, but my head ached consumedly,
and I felt about as sick and wretched
as a man could well be.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/gs02b.png" width="378" height="600" alt="&quot;I felt about as sick and wretched as a man could well be.&quot;"  />
<p class="caption">&quot;I felt about as sick and wretched as a man could well be.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>After a while I sat up, and endeavoured to
puzzle out my position. Where was I? Who
was it had made me prisoner? Was it a simple
act of brigandage, having plunder for its motive,
or had the President discovered the plot against
him and ordered my arrest? Not one of the
questions could I answer. In the hope of being
able to solve the problem of my whereabouts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
however, I got on to my feet and endeavoured to
look out of the window, only to discover that it
was out of my reach, and that I was too weak to
draw myself up to it. I therefore seated myself
on the floor once more, for the room or cell, whichever
I cared to call it, was destitute of furniture,
and resigned myself to my miserable thoughts.</p>

<p>To use a stage expression, it was a pretty
market I had brought my pigs to! I had felt
so confident that my errand was not known, and
that I should succeed in getting safely out of the
country, that I had neglected the most simple
precautions, and in consequence here I was a
prisoner, with the pleasing possibility ahead of me
of either having my throat cut by a common murderer
before the night was past, or, what was
more probable, of being propped against a wall
and shot by President Fernandez' soldiers at
daybreak. The mere knowledge that I was still
alive, and that my watch, chain, and money had
not been taken from me, pointed to the fact
that I was a prisoner of the State, and not of
a private individual. All things considered, it
would be difficult to say which would prove the
worse fate.</p>

<p>Putting aside for the moment the question as to
whose captive I was, I examined my watch, and
discovered that it was just half-past one. Only
an hour had elapsed since the episode on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
wharf&mdash;to me, however, it seemed an Eternity.
After a while, feeling stronger, I got on to my
feet again, and began to pace the room. I also
tried the door, only to find it locked. They had
got me fast enough. So much was certain.
The next time, I told myself, I crossed the
threshold, it would in all probability be to be
haled to a place of execution. For upwards of
an hour I paced the room, calling myself a fool
and idiot, and every other name I could think of,
for having allowed myself to be drawn into
such an affair. I recalled that quiet evening at
Falstead, when the idea of the adventure had
appeared so attractive to me, and, as I did so, it
seemed to me I could hear Molly's gentle voice
saying: "Act as you think best, dear! I know
that it will be all right then." I had certainly
acted on my own judgment, and here I was in
consequence!</p>

<p>I was still thinking of Falstead when a sharp
cry reached me from the yard outside, followed
by a prolonged scuffling noise. Then there was
a heavy fall, another, and yet another. After
that all was silence once more.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter?" I asked
myself. "It sounded like a struggle of some
sort. Can they by any chance have captured
Ferguson, and have brought him here to be my
fellow-prisoner?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>A few moments later some one approached my
door. A key was placed in the lock and turned,
then the door opened, and a man, carrying
a lantern, entered quickly, closing the door
behind him. The upper half of his face was
hidden by a black mask. My astonishment may
be imagined when, after he had removed it, I
discovered that he was none other than Don
Jos&eacute; de Herma&ntilde;os.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he began, holding up his hand as a
sign to me not to speak. "I want you to listen
to what I have to say, and not to interrupt me
until I have finished. In the first place, let me
inform you that the President has discovered
everything! While you were talking to him
to-night at the ball, he knew why you were in
Equinata, and, what is more, had already laid his
plans to effect your arrest. The reason why he
did it so secretly, and why you were not taken
to the regular cartel, is because he does not
want, for reasons of his own, to attract public
attention just at present. I was warned in
time, but was unable to communicate with you.
Now, by a stratagem, we have overpowered your
gaolers, and you are free!"</p>

<p>"But where am I?" I asked, in the same low
voice.</p>

<p>"In the old cartel on the outskirts of the
town," Herma&ntilde;os replied. "Now I want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
pay attention to what I am about to say to you.
There is still time to retrieve matters, if we
go the proper way to work about it. The
President, when he left the ball to-night&mdash;and
now you will be able to understand his reasons
for leaving so early&mdash;drove out to consult with
General Mopaxus, who is lying ill at his
house six miles distant on the road to Sarbassa.
The road in question is hilly, and it will
take him at least an hour to get there. We
will say that he remains with the General an
hour. In that case, he should not reach the
Capital until four o'clock at the earliest. Word
must be sent to the captain of the yacht to shift
his moorings and to have a boat ashore at the
little bay of Horejos at three o'clock. Horejos
is three miles outside the city, and Fernandez
will have to pass through the village on his way
home. We must catch him at any hazard."</p>

<p>"How many men have you with you?"</p>

<p>"Seven," he replied.</p>

<p>"Can they be relied upon?"</p>

<p>"To the death! They know that their own
safety depends upon getting Fernandez out of
the way. Four of them he has suspected for
some time past. They would prefer to shoot
him, and so make sure of him, but as there are
definite orders against that, they feel that the
next best thing they can do is to get him out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the country. And between ourselves, that
is exactly my own case."</p>

<p>"And what about the Guards here?"</p>

<p>"They are safe for the present," he answered.
"But no time must be lost, for it is more than
likely that at daybreak others will come to take
their places."</p>

<p>"And how am I to communicate with
Ferguson?"</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket for a moment.</p>

<p>"Here is a sheet of paper, an envelope, and
a pencil. He knows your writing, of course.
When you have written it, one of my men shall
take it aboard. If he has to get steam up, there
is not any too much time for him to do so.
Every moment is of the utmost importance."</p>

<p>I forthwith pencilled a hasty note to the
captain, bidding him get up steam, weigh anchor,
and have a boat ashore in Horejos Bay at three
o'clock, and stand by to leave Equinata at latest
by four o'clock. This note I handed to Herma&ntilde;os,
and when I had done so, followed him
from the cell.</p>

<p>Once outside, I found myself in a large yard,
illuminated by the bright moonlight. I looked
about me for the bodies of my captors, but was
informed by my companion that they had been
securely bound and placed in an adjoining cell.
On hearing our steps, six figures appeared from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the shadow of the wall. They did not speak,
but at a sign from Herma&ntilde;os, one went on
ahead and opened the gates, whereupon two of
them passed out. After an interval of some
thirty seconds, two more disappeared in the same
mysterious fashion, the remaining pair making
themselves scarce when the same duration of
time had elapsed.</p>

<p>"Now it is our turn," Herma&ntilde;os whispered.
"With the exception of the man who has gone
to the yacht, each company will proceed to the
rendezvous by different routes through the city.
Fernandez has spies everywhere, and we must
be careful that our behaviour does not attract
their attention. To that end I have brought
this poncho and hat for you."</p>

<p>I had noticed a bundle upon the ground, and
had wondered what it might be. My own hat
had disappeared, goodness only knows where. So
placing the sombrero on my head, I pulled the
poncho over my shoulders, and then we, in our
turn, left the cartel.</p>

<p>As Herma&ntilde;os had said, the lock-up was on the
outskirts of the city, and the locality through
which he led me was quite unknown to me.</p>

<p>What was the end of our adventure to be?</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">[Pg 156]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>It was evident to me that Herma&ntilde;os had laid
his plans most carefully, for some hundred and
fifty to two hundred yards from the gate, we
found a vehicle of the <i>volante</i> description awaiting
our coming. We entered it, and the driver,
without asking for instructions, set off at a sharp
pace. We had proceeded some distance before
Don Jos&eacute; spoke.</p>

<p>"I hope you understand, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," he
said at last, "what a serious risk I am running
on your account?"</p>

<p>"Many thanks," I replied. "I am afraid, however,
you do me too much honour. I fancy if it
had only been a question of <i>my</i> safety, I should
have had to appeal to you for some time before
I should have had your assistance."</p>

<p>I spoke out of the bitterness of my heart, half
expecting that my words would offend him. To
my surprise, however, they did not do so. He
only laughed in a quiet way, and then lapsed
into silence once more. The carriage rattled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
through the silent streets, and at length passed
out into the open country on the other side. So
far we had not attracted attention. Eventually
we pulled up at the foot of a steep hill, one side
of which was formed by the mountain, the other
looking down upon a stretch of plain, beyond
which again was the open sea.</p>

<p>"We must climb this hill," said Herma&ntilde;os,
"and when we have descended it again we shall
be at the rendezvous. Let us hope Fernandez
has not made his appearance yet."</p>

<p>We accordingly alighted from the vehicle,
and, when we had seen it return citywards,
began to climb the steep ascent. At the summit,
and just before the hill begins to descend on the
other side, were three palms. When we reached
these my companion uttered a low and peculiar
whistle. It was answered from the shadow,
and a moment later a figure emerged from the
darkness and stood before us. Herma&ntilde;os went
to him and said something in an undertone
which I did not hear.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he remarked when he returned
to me. "Fernandez has not returned yet. They
are watching for him in the valley below, and we
had better join them."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," I replied, for, as you
may suppose, I was eager to have the business
over and done with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>We accordingly descended the hill in the
direction indicated. The road here was little
better than a cart-track, and one that I should
have been very sorry to drive along on a dark
night. In the moonlit valley below could be
seen the little fishing village of Horejos. I examined
my watch and discovered that it wanted
twenty minutes to three o'clock. Needless to
say, I profoundly hoped that Ferguson had received
my message, and that we should find the
boat awaiting us.</p>

<p>When we reached the foot of the hill, it was to
discover that the road ran between two walls of
rock. Blasting operations were accountable at
this point for the existence of the track, which
would otherwise have been impassable. On the
top of the rock on the right, and continuing up
the hill-side, was a thick wood, in which it would
have been possible for some hundreds of men to
have lain concealed. Behind the rock on the
other side was a gentle slope continuing to within
a few dozen yards of the shore. All things considered,
a better place for the work we had in
hand could scarcely have been imagined. It
would have been out of the question for two
carriages to have passed abreast, owing to the
width of the road; and one glance was sufficient
to show me that it would be quite possible for a
determined man to bring a vehicle to a standstill<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
at such a spot. That Herma&ntilde;os was in a state
of considerable trepidation regarding his share in
the business I could see. From what he had
already said to me I gathered that, had he not
advanced so far in the business, he would even
at the eleventh hour have drawn back. Had he
been left to himself, he would doubtless have
allowed General Fernandez' rule to continue
without bothering himself about Silvestre. Unfortunately,
however, Silvestre had obtained too
great a hold upon him, and, in consequence, in
order to cover the shortcomings of his own past,
he had been compelled to take up arms at the
very juncture when he was most desirous of
remaining quietly in the background. Who the
men with him were I had no sort of idea, nor
did he inform me. That they were desperate
like himself I could very well imagine.</p>

<p>When we reached the spot just described,
Herma&ntilde;os again gave utterance to the low and
peculiar whistle I have already mentioned. This
whistle was answered by another, and then a
voice from the darkness said in Spanish, "All is
well! He has not passed yet!"</p>

<p>A moment later a man scrambled down the
bank and stood before us. He wore a poncho,
and had a broad-brimmed sombrero.</p>

<p>"No sign of him yet, Luiz?" Herma&ntilde;os said.</p>

<p>"No, there is no sign yet, se&ntilde;or," the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
replied. "But he can't be long now. In another
hour it will begin to grow light, and if he does
not come before daybreak, then our opportunity
will be gone."</p>

<p>"When he comes, what do you propose to
do?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"I thought that when the carriage arrives
here some of us would appear in the road and
stop the horses, while you go to the door and
cover the President with your revolver."</p>

<p>I should here remark that when Herma&ntilde;os
had handed me the hat and poncho, he had also
given me a heavy Colt's revolver.</p>

<p>"And having done that?" I asked, more
for the sake of seeing what he would say than
for any other reason.</p>

<p>"March him down by the path yonder to the
sea, put him into the boat, and take him out
to the yacht," he answered. "After that you
can do with him as you please."</p>

<p>"I trust the boat has arrived," I said. "Is
there no way of finding out? We ought to make
sure of that!"</p>

<p>"I will send a man to see," he replied, and
then ordered the individual named Luiz to go
to the beach and discover whether the boat was
there.</p>

<p>The fellow made off; and after he had
left us we walked a little further down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
road and seated ourselves upon the bank. A
quarter of an hour passed, during which time we
discussed everything but the business before us.
Then the messenger returned with the information
that the boat was waiting for us, a couple of
hundred yards or so away, in charge of the chief
officer.</p>

<p>"So far, all is well," I said, and as I spoke
the sound of wheels reached us from the distance.</p>

<p>"He is coming," Herma&ntilde;os exclaimed, springing
to his feet; then, turning to the man who
had just returned from the beach, he cried:
"Call the others, Luiz!"</p>

<p>His voice shook with excitement. The words
had scarcely left his lips before Luiz gave a loud
whistle. In response to it three other men made
their appearance from the wood.</p>

<p>"Herma&ntilde;os," I said, taking control of affairs,
as the party began to don their masks, "you and
two of your men had better stand here to stop
the horses." Then turning to the others, I continued:
"You two, follow me; and, if you don't
want to be recognized, let me do whatever
talking there is to be done."</p>

<p>The noise made by the approaching carriage
could now be distinctly heard. At most it could
not be more than a quarter of a mile away. My
heart was beating like a sledge-hammer. Closer
and closer came the vehicle, then it turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
corner, and we could plainly see its lights.
In a very few minutes it would be upon us.
Without exception we had all drawn back into
the shadow of the cliff, so that they could have
no idea of our presence. Descending the little
decline, the carriage entered the cleft between
the rocks. The lights from the vehicle flashed
like angry eyes upon us.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I cried in Spanish, and as I did so
Herma&ntilde;os and his two companions sprang into
the centre of the road. The driver of the carriage,
seeing the revolvers pointed at him, pulled
up his horses so suddenly that they fell back
upon their haunches. Meanwhile I had sprung to
the carriage-door and had opened it. "General
Fernandez," I cried, "you are my prisoner. I
am armed, and if you move hand or foot, I give
you warning, I shall shoot you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile one of my companions had taken a
lamp from the socket and had turned it upon
the interior of the carriage. By its light I was
enabled to convince myself that we had made no
mistake. Fernandez was seated in the corner
nearest me, and, to my great astonishment, the
Se&ntilde;orita was beside him. I will do the President
the justice of saying that, at such a trying
moment, he comported himself like a brave man.
His voice was as calm as ever I had heard it
when he addressed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! so it's you, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, is it?"
he said. "I thought I had stopped your little
game! What's the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"It means that the scheme you did your
best to frustrate has succeeded after all," I
answered. "But I have no time to spare. I
must therefore ask you to alight without further
parley. Let me assure you it would be no use
your attempting to resist. There are six of us
here, and we are all armed."</p>

<p>"It is evident, then, that you have the advantage
of me," he continued, still with the same
imperturbable good-humour. "Well, what must
be must, I suppose," and with that he descended
from the carriage and stepped into the road.</p>

<p>Before I could stop her the Se&ntilde;orita had done
the same.</p>

<p>"Where you go I follow," she said, addressing
the President. "I am sure we can rely upon
Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan's doing us no harm."</p>

<p>"If you do as I ask you not a hair of your
head shall be harmed, Se&ntilde;orita," I replied. Then
turning to the President once more, I added:
"Before we proceed further it would, perhaps,
be as well to make sure that you are not armed,
General! We cannot afford to run any risk."</p>

<p>Fernandez gave a short laugh as he took a
revolver from his pocket and handed it to me.</p>

<p>"I was going to use this upon you as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
as I had an opportunity," he said. "I see,
however, that I am not to be permitted to do
so!"</p>

<p>I turned to the coachman.</p>

<p>"Now, off you go!" I cried. "If you stop
anywhere between here and the palace I'll take
care that you hear about it later. You can tell
them, when you get there, that the President
and the Se&ntilde;orita have gone into the country for
a change of air, and that you don't quite know
when they will be back."</p>

<p>The man did not answer, but looked at Fernandez
as if for instructions. Seeing that the
other did not speak, he whipped up his horses
and drove off without another word, leaving his
master and mistress prisoners with us.</p>

<p>"Now we in our turn will be off," I said, as
he disappeared over the brow of the hill. "I
must ask you, Se&ntilde;or President, to be good
enough to walk ahead. The Se&ntilde;orita and I will
follow you."</p>

<p>It was a silent little party that made its way
down the hill-side towards the beach. First
walked the President with an armed man on
either side of him, his niece and myself followed
next, whilst Herma&ntilde;os and two of his fellow-conspirators
brought up the rear. No one would
have imagined that, only a few hours before, the
Se&ntilde;orita and I had been waltzing round the ball-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
at La Gloria as partners, or that the President
and I had been seated amicably together
discussing the politics of Equinata in all apparent
friendliness. I must say in common fairness
that, even under these trying circumstances,
the Se&ntilde;orita behaved herself with as much coolness
as did her fellow-prisoner. Not once did
she flinch or show the least sign of fear.</p>

<p>The path from the road to the shore was an
exceedingly rough one, little better in fact than
a goat-track, and as the Se&ntilde;orita was still wearing
her light dancing-shoes, it must have been an
unenviable experience for her. Once her dress
was caught by a cactus leaf, and I stopped to extricate
it for her. I hoped that my action might
break the silence that had so far characterized
our march.</p>

<p>"Thank you, se&ntilde;or," she said gravely, and,
without another word, continued her walk.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I said at last, "I can quite understand
how angry you must feel with me. I suppose
it is only natural that you should be. Yet,
strange though it may appear, I cannot help
feeling ashamed."</p>

<p>"I am not angry, se&ntilde;or," she replied. "My
only regret is that we should have been so weak
as to have made such a miscalculation. I thought
my uncle had caused you to be arrested?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did have me arrested, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
managed to escape," I answered. "Doubtless, if
your uncle had had his way, he would have had
me shot at daybreak."</p>

<p>"It is more than likely," she replied, still with
the same gravity. "And all things considered,
I am not at all sure it would not have been
better for the happiness of Equinata could this
event have taken place."</p>

<p>After such a speech there was not much to
be said, so we continued our walk in silence.
Ten minutes later we reached the beach, walked
along it for a hundred yards or so, and then
found ourselves beside the yacht's gig, which
had been pulled up on the shore to await our
coming. As soon as they saw us the boat's
crew, led by the chief officer, made their appearance
from a hollow in the sand-hills where they
had been concealed.</p>

<p>"Permit me to help you into the boat," I said
to the Se&ntilde;orita, moving towards it as I spoke.
"When you are on board we can push her out
into deeper water."</p>

<p>She accordingly took my hand and stepped
into the boat, after which the men ran it into
the water.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. President," I continued, "if you
will be so kind as to get in, I think we had
better be moving."</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before we do so, might I have a word with
you in private, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan?" he said. "I
will not detain you more than a few moments."</p>

<p>I answered in the affirmative, and we moved
a few paces away together. To make sure that
he played no trick upon me, I took my revolver
from my pocket and carried it somewhat ostentatiously
in my hand. He noticed the precaution
and gave utterance to one of his peculiar laughs.</p>

<p>"You need have no fear," he said. "I shall
not run away. My heart, as you may have
heard, is a little weak, and I am afraid a sharp
run on this sand would not tend to improve it.
Let us talk here. Now, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, I am
going to put a very simple question to you. I
very naturally presume that you have been well
paid by my rival, Don Guzman de Silvestre, to
effect my capture and deportation?"</p>

<p>"It is scarcely necessary for me to admit that
fact," I answered. "Yes! All things considered,
I am <i>very</i> well paid."</p>

<p>"Needless to remark," he continued, "I have
no desire to leave Equinata. Nor am I anxious
to find myself in my old enemy's hands. The
question I wish to put to you, therefore, is this:
What would your price be to let me go?"</p>

<p>"I cannot answer that question," I replied,
"and for the simple reason that I am unable to
let you go at all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be willing to pay a large sum in
cash, and, what is more, I would give you a substantial
guarantee that, if you would leave La
Gloria to-morrow, I would let you depart in
peace."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, General Fernandez," I said,
"but I am afraid you have made some little
mistake in your estimation of my character. I
will be perfectly candid with you, and will admit
that, if I could live the past few weeks over
again, I should not be treating you as I am
doing to-night. However, I have accepted Don
Guzman's offer, and I have taken his money.
For that reason I cannot take yours, nor can I
let you go, glad as I should be to do so. I
wonder what you would have done with me, had
I not had the good fortune to escape from the
cartel to-night?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you exactly," he answered. "You
would have shared your quarters with some of
your fellow-conspirators, and I should have shot
you in the morning. Experience has taught me
that there is nothing like dispatch in these
matters. Strike home, and strike hard, is my
motto."</p>

<p>"So I have been given to understand," I
replied dryly. "And now let us return to the
boat."</p>

<p>"You are still determined not to let me go?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
he said. "What do you say to an offer of
twenty thousand pounds, in English money?"</p>

<p>"I could not do it for fifty thousand," I
replied. "Come along, sir, the dawn will soon
be here, and I am anxious to be out of Equinata
before it comes."</p>

<p>He gave a little shrug of the shoulders as I
spoke, and then moved towards the boat.</p>

<p>"One more question," he said before we joined
the others. "Where are you going to take me?"</p>

<p>"I shall hope to be able to show you that in a
very short time," I answered. "For the present,
however, it must remain a secret. Now, sir, into
the boat, if you please."</p>

<p>Before he got in he turned to Don Jos&eacute; de
Herma&ntilde;os, who was standing with his friends by
the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Don Jos&eacute;," he said, as genially as
if he were addressing a valued acquaintance. "I
wonder whether you and I are destined to meet
again? As you are aware, I have a good memory
for both friends and enemies! I once imagined
that you and I would have been able to work
together. I believe we should have done so, had
not you committed yourself too deeply to my
rival before I was able to bring my influence to
bear upon you. I should put that mask in my
pocket if I were you. You forget that you have
a mole upon your chin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The man he addressed stepped back a pace as
if he had been struck. He had disguised himself
so carefully that he thought detection was impossible.
Nevertheless, he had omitted to conceal
a disfigurement on the lower portion of his countenance
that was sufficient to reveal his identity
to any one at all acquainted with him. His
astonishment may have accounted for his failure
to reply to the other's speech.</p>

<p>The President having taken his place beside
the Se&ntilde;orita, I prepared to follow him, but before
doing so I held out my hand to Herma&ntilde;os.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my friend," I said. "I owe you
something for what you have done for me to-night.
I don't suppose we shall ever meet again,
but, if we do, I trust it may be under happier
auspices."</p>

<p>"I never want to see your face again," he
replied, with a candour that was somewhat remarkable.
Then, lowering his voice to a whisper,
he continued: "For your own safety's sake, take
care that you never come back to Equinata. I
cannot help thinking that it would have been
better if we had shot him out of hand. I fancy
you will agree with me before you have done."</p>

<p>His voice must have travelled further than he
intended, for the President heard it and uttered
a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>"Always the same, always the same," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
mockingly. "You know what ought to be done,
but you don't do it. As somebody has said,
you let 'I would' wait upon 'I dare!'"</p>

<p>At the same moment a sob escaped the
Se&ntilde;orita. This decided me, and springing into
the boat I gave the order to shove off. The
crew stood up and pushed with their oars, and a
moment later we were afloat. When the men
sat down and bent to their work I glanced back
at the little group of dark figures on the beach
watching us. After a few minutes they were lost
against the dark background, and I turned my
head to search for the yacht. Already the sky
was paling preparatory to the dawn, and I knew
that, if we did not hasten, we should scarcely
be clear of the coast by daylight. At last we
reached the yacht, and pulled up at the accommodation
ladder.</p>

<p>"Allow me to help you, Se&ntilde;orita," I said,
springing out and giving her my hand.</p>

<p>Presently we stood together on the deck.
Ferguson raised his cap, and I could see that he
was more than surprised at seeing a lady standing
before him.</p>

<p>"We will get away from here as soon as
possible, Mr. Ferguson, if you please," I said.
"I want to be clear of La Gloria before daylight."</p>

<p>"Everything is ready, sir," he replied, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
as soon as we have got the boat aboard I'll give
the order for full steam ahead."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," I said, turning to the
Se&ntilde;orita, "permit me to escort you to the saloon.
Doubtless you are ready for some supper after
your long drive."</p>

<p>I was determined that my coolness should
equal hers. Nothing was to be gained by acting
the part of the stern gaoler. We accordingly
passed along the deck to the saloon. The electric
bell summoned the attentive chief steward, to
whom I gave orders that a meal should be
prepared for us immediately.</p>

<p>I cannot attempt to make you understand how
beautiful the Se&ntilde;orita looked as she divested
herself of her cloak and seated herself on the
luxurious divan that ran round the saloon. It
must be remembered that she had driven out
from the city dressed just as she had been at the
ball, and as this thought crossed my mind I was
struck with wonderment as to what she would
do for wearing apparel on board. She could not
spend the day in a low-necked dress, and with
no stronger footgear than a pair of white satin
dancing-shoes. However, I postponed consideration
of the subject for the moment. Presently
the steward reappeared, the cloth was laid, and
a meal placed upon the table. My message
from the cartel had given them time to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
it, I suppose; at any rate, it was as delightful a
little supper as any one could wish to partake
of. We sat down to it, as strange a trio as you
would discover in a very long day's sail.</p>

<p>Fernandez still wore his ribbon and orders;
the Se&ntilde;orita, as I have already observed, was in
evening dress with a <i>collet</i> of diamonds round
her neck. I also was attired just as I had been
at the ball, though my raiment was somewhat
dishevelled by my encounter with the Presidential
Forces on the wharf. We had scarcely sat
down at the table before the throbbing of the
propellor announced the fact that we were
under way. Almost involuntarily I looked at
the President.</p>

<p>"Our voyage has commenced," he said. "I
drink to your health, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan!"</p>

<p>I drew a long deep breath of relief. It
was something to know that we were leaving
Equinata at last, and that I had got the President
aboard. Since his treatment of me that
evening, I felt no remorse for having captured
him. He had admitted that he would have shot
me without compunction had I remained in his
power. He could scarcely blame me, therefore,
if I experienced a feeling of delight in having
turned the tables upon him.</p>

<p>"I must say your employer is by no means
niggardly to you," remarked Fernandez, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the servants had withdrawn. "As you do not
provide it, I suppose it is not a breach of good
manners to observe that this wine is excellent,
while the cooking is all that can be desired."
Then, with a little sigh, whether real or assumed,
he continued: "My own <i>chef</i> will now, I suppose,
be obliged to seek another situation. And
in some respects he was unrivalled. Well, well,
it's the fortune of war!"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, is there no way of arranging
for our return to Equinata?" asked the
Se&ntilde;orita, leaning a little forward and placing one
dainty hand upon my coat-sleeve, while she
looked pleadingly into my face.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," I replied. "Don
Fernandez and I have already discussed that
matter together, and have come to the conclusion
that it is impossible."</p>

<p>She rose from her chair. I thought she was
going to break down, but she managed to retain
her composure.</p>

<p>"If you will allow me, I think I will retire to
my cabin," she said.</p>

<p>I rang the bell for the steward and inquired
what state-room had been set aside for the lady.
He informed me, and I immediately begged permission
to conduct her thither. She bade her
uncle good-night and we set off together. When
she reached the door she turned to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel sure you will be sorry some day for
the part you have played to-night," she remarked.
"Why should you wish to take us away from
the country in which we were so happy, and for
which we have done so much?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that I am not my own
master," I replied. "I am a paid servant, and
must do as I am ordered."</p>

<p>She heaved a heavy sigh, and then, without
another word, turned and entered the cabin. I
thereupon returned to the saloon to find that
Fernandez had left it and had gone on deck. I
discovered him upon the bulwarks opposite the
smoking-room entrance. He had just lit a cigar,
and was doubtless meditating on his position.
The yacht was cleaving her way through the
water, and already the lights of La Gloria lay
far behind us.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, General?" I
inquired as I took my position alongside him.</p>

<p>"I was thinking how I could manage to outwit
you," he replied.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">[Pg 176]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>It was with a feeling of profound thankfulness
that I turned into my bunk that morning. The
clattering of feet on deck, and the slapping of the
water against the sides, greeted my ears like the
sweetest music. Only a few hours before I had
deemed myself as good as a dead man. I had been
the prisoner of a man without the bowels of compassion,
and, what was worse, I knew that I had
proved myself a traitor, and had not the ghost of
a chance of effecting my escape. Now, however,
I was free once more, and in a few days my
mission to Equinata would be accomplished;
after which I should be at liberty to return to
England, to marry Molly, and to settle down to
a very different life to that which I had been
leading for the past few weeks. When I fell
asleep, it was to dream that I was back at Falstead
once more. I was smoking a pipe in the
front garden, and Molly, seated in the shade of
our favourite tree, was reading me an account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
a terrible revolution that had taken place in the
Republic of Equinata.</p>

<p>"The President, Jos&eacute; de Herma&ntilde;os is his
name," she said, "has been assassinated. It
appears that he married the niece of his predecessor,
General Fernandez!"</p>

<p>That would have been strange enough in all
conscience!</p>

<p>Owing, I suppose, to the lateness of my
retiring, I was not very early astir, and when I
reached the deck I made my way up to the
bridge. It was the second mate's watch, but I
had not been there very long before Captain Ferguson
left his cabin and joined us. Thereupon
the mate, with a knowledge of what was correct
under such circumstances, crossed to the other
side of the bridge, leaving us free to talk
together concerning the events of the previous
night.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a fright I had, Mr.
Trevelyan," said the captain. "I sent a boat
ashore as directed, and after waiting an hour and
a half it returned to report that you had not put
in an appearance. I had quite made up my mind
that you had been captured."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I was," I replied, and
proceeded to give him an outline of my adventures
during the evening.</p>

<p>"This will be the last of this sort of business<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
for me," he said, when he heard me out. "The
game is far from being worth the candle. I
wonder what the end of it all will be? From what
I gathered when ashore, and also from what you
have told me, I have come to the conclusion that
whatever Don Silvestre's ambition may be, he
has lost his hold upon Equinata. If he is fool
enough to return, I fancy he will find that the
other's party is still too strong for him. The
part of a President of a South American Republic
is not an easy one to play."</p>

<p>"The wonder to me is that they ever get any
one to play it at all," I answered. "Thank
goodness, however, we have fulfilled our portion
of the contract; we have got Fernandez, and
that's all that can be expected of us."</p>

<p>"I think I understood you to say that the
lady who accompanies him is a relative?"</p>

<p>"She is his niece, and a very beautiful woman."</p>

<p>"If you were to ask me, I should say that I
was more afraid of her than of him. Stand by
and keep your eye open for squalls, would be my
motto if I had to deal with her."</p>

<p>"You may be very sure that I will do that,"
I replied. "I think I know the length of her
ladyship's foot."</p>

<p>I thought of the time we had spent together
in the balcony of the Opera House, and how
strangely her seriousness had affected me. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
was difficult to believe that it had all been a
mere piece of acting.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour or so later, when I had left the
bridge and had walked aft, Fernandez made his
appearance on deck.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, se&ntilde;or," I said, with a bow to
him. "In compliment to you we are favoured
with a delightful morning."</p>

<p>"Delightful indeed," he replied, throwing a
glance over the stern. "We are well on our
way, I suppose, and steering due north, I observe.
Let me see, if I am not mistaken, that should be
in the direction of&mdash;&mdash;" Here he looked at me
interrogatively, as if he expected me to answer
his question.</p>

<p>"In the direction of New York, shall we say?"
I answered. "If we continue as we are going
long enough, I have no doubt we shall see the
Goddess of Liberty holding her torch aloft."</p>

<p>"The illustration is scarcely a pleasing one,"
he returned, "since I am a prisoner. The Goddess
of Liberty has not done very much for me.
But there, nothing is to be gained by repining!
I have been in worse positions than this before
to-day, and have always managed to get out of
them with some sort of credit to myself."</p>

<p>"I hope you may do so in this instance," I
answered, "but not while I have the charge of
you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," he said at
last, "I have come to the conclusion that I like
you. I did not do so at first, but my opinion
of you has changed."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear you say so," I replied;
"but I confess I can scarcely see why you should
have changed your mind regarding myself. If
there is one man in the world whom I despise, it
is myself."</p>

<p>"And I fancy I can understand why," he continued,
still with the same grave look upon his
face. "You must not, however, think badly of
yourself, for I can assure you, you have managed
this business remarkably well. The plot was
excellently arranged. There is one thing, however,
that puzzles me; that is, how Herma&ntilde;os
managed to overcome the Guards at the cartel?
I quite imagined that the men were to be relied
on."</p>

<p>"I cannot give you any information on that
point," I replied, knowing that it was useless to
endeavour to conceal the fact that Herma&ntilde;os
was present on that occasion. "I had no knowledge
of the affair until the door was opened and
I discovered that I was free."</p>

<p>"Some day I shall hope to be even with our
friend Herma&ntilde;os," Fernandez replied, more to
himself than to me. "I have always had my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
suspicions about the man, but I never dreamt
that he would rise to such a height as he has
done in this affair. I deemed him a coward
throughout."</p>

<p>"And a coward he is," I answered. "He is
scheming now to save his own neck."</p>

<p>"The most dangerous conspirator you can
have to deal with," Fernandez remarked. "Such
a man lacks the saving grace of Ambition. He
who risks his life for fame and fortune must have
something good in him, but the individual who
embarks upon a conspiracy, and who would throw
over and denounce his friends on finding that
his own participation in the plot is about to be
discovered, is neither fish, flesh, nor fowl. There
was a time when I could have had Herma&ntilde;os
for the holding up of a finger, but I wanted
men of firmer metal, men like yourself, for
instance."</p>

<p>"You pay me a great compliment," I answered.
"Unfortunately, however, we met too late in the
day. My services were already bespoken."</p>

<p>At that moment a steward approached him
with a cup of chocolate and a roll.</p>

<p>"This is luxury in bondage," he remarked as
he took it. Then, with a smile, he added: "If
you had been breakfasting in the cartel this
moment, I should probably have only allowed
you bread and water."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"With a dozen bullets in my body to help me
digest it," I thought to myself.</p>

<p>It was considerably past ten o'clock before the
Se&ntilde;orita made her appearance on deck. The
question of her attire had occurred to me earlier,
and, in consequence, I had procured for her a
cloth pilot-coat from the third mate, who, as fortune
had it, was only a little fellow, and had
placed it at her door. This she now wore, and
though the garment was somewhat incongruous,
when the rest of her attire was taken into consideration,
the effect was by no means unbecoming.
On leaving the companion she looked
about her, and then ran her eye along the sky-line,
as if in the hope of being able to discover
her whereabouts. The yacht was pitching a
little at the time, but I noticed that she balanced
herself as cleverly as any old sailor could have
done. She bade us good-morning, but did not
take the chair I offered her.</p>

<p>"I wonder what they are doing at the palace,"
she said, more to her uncle than to myself. "I
hope they will not forget to feed my poor little
birds. I wonder if I shall ever see them again?"</p>

<p>"So long as there is life there is hope," replied
the President. "Is that not so, Se&ntilde;or
Trevelyan?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," I answered. "Who knows
but that you may be back in La Gloria again<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
before many months are past. Who is likely to
be appointed President in your absence?"</p>

<p>"General Sagana," Fernandez returned; "and,
by the way, he was the man who introduced you
to me. I must endeavour to remember that fact
when next he and I meet!"</p>

<p>The expression on his face as he said this was
not altogether a pleasant one.</p>

<p>Hour after hour we steamed steadily on our
course. The day was warm, the sea as smooth
as glass, and the sky a perfect blue. We passed
two vessels, but signalled neither. By midday
our run totalled a hundred and twenty-five miles,
a very fair record, all things considered. As for
my passengers and myself we spent the greater
part of the day under the for'ard awning, where
we amused ourselves and each other as best we
could. Had any stranger looked in upon us, he
or she would have found it difficult to realize our
respective positions. I had not the appearance
of a gaoler, and no one would have guessed that
the President, leaning back in his chair, cigar in
mouth, was the head of an influential country
and an abducted citizen.</p>

<p>The memory of our dinner that evening will
never be effaced from my mind. It forms one
of a number of strange mental pictures connected
with that more than extraordinary time.
The Se&ntilde;orita, who had discarded the pea-jacket<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I have already referred to, appeared in all the
bravery of her previous evening's apparel. The
President had perforce to follow her example,
and though he had discarded his ribbon, he still
wore his orders. I on my part, out of compliment
to them, dressed myself with great care,
while Captain Ferguson, who shared the meal
with us, had also made an elaborate toilet.
The beautiful saloon, the noiseless servants, the
lavish table decorations, the excellent <i>menu</i>, and
the rare wines, all combined to play their parts
in a scene that must almost be without a parallel.
After dinner we adjourned to the deck above,
where we seated ourselves and smoked until
bed-time.</p>

<p>It would have been instructive to have known
what thoughts were passing in the minds of
the various members of our party as we men
lay in our chairs upon the deck. That the
Se&ntilde;orita was really the President's niece I do
not, and shall never believe. I have my own
reasons for making this statement, and they
are fairly conclusive. The President himself
was an adventurer of the most determined
description. Ferguson was a sea captain and
but little better&mdash;(he was a married man, so I
discovered later, and his wife kept a small girls'
school in a village near Plymouth), while I&mdash;well,
you know all there is to tell so far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
am concerned, so I need say no more on that
subject. Taken altogether, however, we were a
queer quartette.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the Se&ntilde;orita declared herself
sleepy and retired to her cabin, Ferguson went
up to the bridge to see how things were there,
while the President and I started to patrol the
deck. In the hour that followed I learnt more
of his past life than I had ever known before.
I knew very well that his career had been an
extraordinary one, but I had never dreamt that
it had been so strange as his telling made it
appear. He was born in a village near Madrid.
His parents were poor but of noble birth. In
due course he entered the army, but after a
time the life of a private soldier disgusted him,
and he exchanged the profession of arms for
that of an assistant to a sugar planter on the
island of St. Vincent. An unfortunate love
affair with the planter's daughter threw him
upon the world again, penniless. From the
island he drifted to the mainland of South
America, saw a good deal of Revolutionary
fighting, and for the first time tried his hand
at the fascinating game of politics. The result
was by no means satisfactory, for he had the
misfortune to throw in his lot with the losing
side. After a certain particularly stubborn
battle he was captured and condemned to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
shot&mdash;a foretaste of the fate he had arranged
for me. At the last moment, however, the
sentence was commuted to penal servitude for
life, and he was sent to the mines. Eventually
he was liberated and took service with the
man who, up to that time, had been his greatest
enemy. He climbed the ladder of fame, and
in time he managed to win a fair amount of
power in the land; another Revolution, however,
cast this power to the winds, and sent him flying
post-haste to the islands of the Pacific. In one
way and another he enlarged his experience there,
saw life as a trader, a pearler, and an agent
for the native labour traffic as he euphemistically
termed it. At last he found himself on board a
schooner returning to Valparaiso. It was then
that he first met Silvestre, and for some considerable
time the two men were on the most
friendly terms. Fernandez, who had been
warned as to what was shortly to happen,
discovered a post for the time being as a clerk
to an auctioneer. Then came the big Revolution&mdash;Fernandez
chose the winning side, Silvestre
the losing. The latter departed to Equinata&mdash;which
country at that time was just coming into
notice&mdash;while his friend remained in Chili to
derive what profit he could for himself from his
loyalty to the party he had assisted into Power.</p>

<p>"As soon as I had saved sufficient money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
however," he continued, "I quitted the Republic
and, after one or two other adventures with
which I will not trouble you, found myself
stranded in Equinata. To my astonishment I
discovered that my old partner Silvestre had
made the best use of his time there, and by
an extraordinary manipulation of circumstances
had managed to become a person of considerable
importance in the Republic. So far as I was concerned,
however, there was another <i>hegira</i>, and
this time at a somewhat short notice. I next
visited the United States, afterwards crossed the
Atlantic to Europe, and, after an absence of some
three years, found myself once more in La
Gloria. When I reached that country I discovered
that a strange change had taken
place. Silvestre, who, though he had held a
position of some importance when I was last
in Equinata, had shown no sign of any great
ability, was now President, and had even greater
ambitions. Needless to say I threw in my lot
with him and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eventually ousted him from his position?"
I put in. "I have heard that part of the story
from the man himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I confess I did oust him," he answered,
taking his cigar from his mouth and knocking
the ash off against the rail. "The victory is to
the strongest, and if Silvestre had been stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
than I&mdash;well&mdash;he would have won. As it was,
he fled the country. Whereupon I picked up
the reins of Government, played the game as I
thought it should be played, and now find myself
and all my plans upset, I trust you will
forgive my plain speaking, by a man who only
a few months ago was chief officer on board
a South American mail-boat. Who can say
what the next chapter of the story will be?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have had a very good innings,
and I don't see that you have any right to
complain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he replied. "But don't run
away with the idea that, because you've trapped
me, I am beaten. I'm a long way off that!
Believe me, I know exactly how far you are
concerned in the business, and I tell you this,
if you are wise, you will be advised by me, and
drop out of it as soon as you can. The time
will come when Don Guzman de Silvestre and
I will have to settle accounts together, and if
you are a prudent man you will have balanced
your books with him and have departed long
before that."</p>

<p>"I think I am very well able to take care
of myself," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Ah! We all think that! Sometimes, however,
we find we are wrong."</p>

<p>A few moments later he bade me good-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and retired to his cabin. I accompanied him so
far as the saloon companion entrance and then
returned to my chair on deck. I had not been
there many minutes before Ferguson joined
me.</p>

<p>"We shall have to keep a sharp look-out on
our friend, Don Fernandez," he said, after he
had lit a cigar. "I don't trust him a little
bit."</p>

<p>"How so?" I inquired. "What has he been
up to now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very much that I know of," the
captain replied, "but I have a sort of notion
that he has been endeavouring to sound some
of the men as to the chance of seizing the boat.
He has said nothing outright, but Reston (the
boatswain) tells me he dropped a hint to him
that a large reward would be forthcoming if he
and his niece were helped ashore again. He has
a most persuasive manner, unlimited wealth, and
there's not very much, I fancy, that he would
stop at."</p>

<p>"I suppose you can place implicit trust in
your officers and crew?" I said.</p>

<p>"Implicit trust," he answered. "But with a
man like Fernandez aboard one cannot take too
many precautions."</p>

<p>"You are right," I replied. "At the same
time, I must admit that I like the man. More,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
perhaps, than I do&mdash;well, another gentleman
with whom we are both acquainted."</p>

<p>Ferguson understood my meaning.</p>

<p>"I understand," he replied. "And what's
more I agree with you."</p>

<p>When we had chatted for upwards of an hour
I bade him good-night, and went below to my
cabin to fall asleep and dream that Fernandez
had seized the boat and was going to make me
walk the plank at daylight.</p>

<p>In two days we were due to arrive at the
island. From the progress we were making,
and from the glimpse I had of the chart, it
struck me that we should reach San Diaz
between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the following afternoon I
was standing at the taffrail, looking at the
frothing wake astern, and thinking of something
very far removed from Equinata and her
President. As a matter of fact I was wondering
how long it would be before I should see
Falstead again, and what sort of welcome I
should receive from Molly and my mother on
my return, when I caught the sound of a light
footstep behind me. I turned my head to
discover the Se&ntilde;orita. She came and stood
beside me resting her jewelled hands upon the
rail. It did not take me long to become aware
that she was in one of her curious moods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Her manner was most persuasive and seductive
to a degree, and once or twice I found myself
admiring her beauty, and for the moment
forgetting how dangerous a woman she was.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Se&ntilde;orita," I said, "that since
we danced together in the Opera House I have
fallen woefully in your estimation."</p>

<p>"Why should that be so?" she answered.
"I admire your resource, and however much I
may deplore it, cannot help but admire the
cleverness with which you carried out your
scheme, in spite of the opposition you received.
Had you been working for us I should have
offered you my heartiest congratulations, but
since we are the victims of your skill, you can
scarcely expect me to be so magnanimous. Oh!
Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, how I wish I could have persuaded
you to side with us. But you had already
cast in your lot with the enemy. At one time
I had almost begun to think that I was deceived
in you, but the other night when you refused
my uncle's bribe I realized your real character.
To a man of such enterprise as you possess anything
is possible. Have you never experienced
a longing for power yourself? If I were a man,
my ambition would be limitless. As it is, I can
only admire what I see of it in others!"</p>

<p>Recalling that conversation now, it seems as
plain to me as daylight that she was doing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
best to hoodwink me. I must confess, however,
that at the time I failed entirely to see through
her motive. As I have said before she was a
beautiful woman, and she had the advantage of
also being an extremely clever one. No one will
ever know the temptations she placed before me
that evening, and I think it says something for
my love for Molly&mdash;not to mention my sense of
duty to Silvestre, that I did not give way to her.
By some mysterious means she had discovered the
bond that existed between Ferguson and myself;
she knew also that I was all-powerful aboard
the yacht, and if she did not prevail upon me
to turn the boat's head about and convey them
back to Equinata, well, it was certainly not for
want of trying. I proved adamant, however,
and when at last she left me and went below
it must have been with the consciousness that
she had not only failed in her scheme but had
done herself harm into the bargain.</p>

<p>"You have had the pleasure of my niece's
company for some considerable time," said
Fernandez, when I joined him some minutes
later. "I hope you have had a pleasant and
instructive conversation!"</p>

<p>There was a scarcely-concealed sneer in his
voice that I did not fail to notice.</p>

<p>"The Se&ntilde;orita has been endeavouring to
undermine my loyalty to Silvestre," I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
blurting out the truth without fear of the consequences.
"She has promised me, on your
behalf, all sorts of rewards if I will turn traitor
and run the boat back to La Gloria."</p>

<p>"And I gather from your tone that she was
not successful," he replied. "You are a very
pillar of rectitude, my friend."</p>

<p>"What is more," I continued, ignoring his
sneer, and making up my mind to let him have
it from the shoulder while I was about it, "I
hear from Captain Ferguson that you have
been endeavouring to tamper with the crew.
I should be sorry, se&ntilde;or, to be compelled to
confine you to your cabin for the rest of the
voyage, but if this sort of thing continues I
fear there will be no other course left open to
me."</p>

<p>"You surely would not have me neglect an
opportunity when it presents itself?" he returned,
still with the same curious smile upon
his face. "I have as much right to try to help
myself out of this hole as you had to get me
into it. However, as your men appear to be
as immaculate and bribe-proof as their leaders,
I will give you my assurance that I will not
tamper with their honour again. Will that satisfy
you?"</p>

<p>"As long as you stick to it," I replied. "But
I warn you that I shall keep a strict watch upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
you, and if you play me false you know what
you may expect."</p>

<p>From that moment I had no more trouble with
either of them. The Se&ntilde;orita adopted a haughty
air towards me. The President, on the other
hand, made himself even more agreeable to me
than he had been before.</p>

<p>One day later, and, as I expected, a little
before sun-down, a small speck appeared upon
the horizon. This gradually increased in size
until it developed into a small densely-wooded
island.</p>

<p>"That," said Ferguson, who was standing
beside me on the bridge, "is San Diaz!"</p>

<p>"And, thank goodness, our destination!"</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">[Pg 195]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>The island of San Diaz is some fifteen miles
long by eight wide. From end to end it is
densely wooded; in fact, a large proportion of
its area is still primeval forest. The population
numbers only a few hundreds, and the majority
of the inhabitants are black. For the most part
they are a retiring race. How they live, or what
they live upon, would at first glance seem difficult
to understand; but they appear to enjoy life
in their harmless way, and, being cut off from
certain doubtful blessings of our so-called Civilization,
they generally manage to elude the
clutches of old Boney for a longer space of time
than do their brethren in better known and
more popular climes.</p>

<p>As I observed at the close of the preceding
chapter, I was on the bridge with Ferguson when
we first sighted the island. After a close consultation
of the chart that he held in his hand,
he put his helm up, and hugged the shore for
a distance of something like five miles. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
finding himself at the entrance of a fair-sized
bay, he turned in and prepared to seek an
anchorage. The view from the deck at that
moment was a very pleasing one. First the
blue water of the bay, then a white beach, after
which the ground began to ascend until it
reached, in a somewhat precipitous slope, a
plateau at an elevation of something like two
hundred feet above sea-level. On this plateau,
nestling among the trees, stood a long white
house, with several smaller buildings clustered
round it. As we watched, the report of a firearm
reached us from the settlement, followed
by another and yet another in quick succession.
It was the signal I had arranged for with
Silvestre, and it proclaimed the fact that he
was aware of our arrival.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit distrustful about the soundings,"
said Ferguson, as we steamed slowly in. "This
chart is no sort of good. However, I don't think
we can do much harm here."</p>

<p>Then holding up his hand to the chief mate,
who was in charge of the anchor on the fo'c'sle-head,
he signalled to him to let go. The roar of
the cable through the hawse-hole followed, and a
few seconds later the yacht was at anchor. When
the vessel was stationary I descended the ladder
from the bridge to find the President and the
Se&ntilde;orita leaning on the port-bulwarks attentively<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
studying the shore. Still Fernandez showed no
sign of any sort of trepidation. Yet he must have
realized how dangerous was his position. He
had admitted that he had done Silvestre a great
wrong, and he could scarcely fail to be aware
that the latter, having him at his mercy,
would be certain to retaliate. Yet here he was
chattering as coolly with the Se&ntilde;orita as if he
were sitting on the terrace at his palace in La
Gloria. The man was the possessor of an iron
nerve which nothing could shake. Moreover, as
he had informed me on another occasion, he was
a fatalist.</p>

<p>"What is arranged will certainly happen," he
had then remarked to me. "If I am to be
assassinated in the street, it is quite certain I
shall not be drowned at sea. If I am to die in
my bed, it will not be on the battlefield. Why
should I worry myself if the end is ordained for
me?"</p>

<p>When he had seen everything secure, Ferguson
left the bridge and joined us.</p>

<p>"Are you going ashore, Mr. Trevelyan," he
inquired, "or will you wait on board until they
send out to us?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be better to wait," I replied.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, they are launching a
boat now," Fernandez remarked.</p>

<p>What he said was correct. Several men had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
descended the steep path from the plateau already
mentioned, and were even then running a boat
across the sands towards the water. When she was
afloat, they hung about her as if not certain what
to do next. A few seconds later, however, a
man, dressed in white, appeared from among the
trees and joined them. He entered the boat,
whereupon it began to move towards us. As
she approached I noticed that she was pulled by
four stalwart negroes, and that the man steering
her was not Silvestre as I had expected, but a
younger man, and a mulatto. As soon as the
boat reached the ladder, he sprang nimbly on to
the grating and ran up to us.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan!" he said, looking from
one to the other of us as if to discover whom
he should address.</p>

<p>"That is my name," I answered. "Have you
a message for me?" Before he replied, he took
me on one side.</p>

<p>"Don Guzman de Silvestre is not well," he
said. "He bids me say, however, that you had
better bring your prisoner up to the house without
delay."</p>

<p>"He is not aware, of course, that a lady has
accompanied us?" I remarked.</p>

<p>The other shook his head, and then turned
his eyes in the direction of the spot where the
Se&ntilde;orita was standing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will not be pleased," he said.</p>

<p>I felt that I would give something to know
what preparations Silvestre had made for Fernandez'
reception; but I did not put any questions
to the messenger, feeling that in all probability
his master had given orders to him to
be silent.</p>

<p>"Can you carry four people in the boat?" I
inquired, going to the side and looking down at
the craft in question.</p>

<p>"Half-a-dozen, if you wish," he answered;
"she will not sink with us."</p>

<p>I thereupon went back to the President.</p>

<p>"If you are quite ready, I think we will land
at once," I said. "It will be dark very soon."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and remarked that
he would go below and fetch his cloak. The
Se&ntilde;orita suggested that she should follow his
example. Fearing that there was a possible
chance of their outwitting me at the last moment,
I declared that I could not hear of their taking
so much trouble, and thereupon despatched one
of the stewards in search of the articles in question.
When they were brought on deck, we
descended to the boat alongside and started for
the shore.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached it, I sprang from the
boat and helped the Se&ntilde;orita to disembark.
Then, guided by the half-caste, whose name I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
discovered was Manuel, we set to work to climb
the steep ascent to the buildings I had seen from
the yacht. If the descent at Horejos had been
steep, this was ten times more so. The path,
if path it could be called, was one long climb,
and wound its way in and out through the thick
undergrowth in a most disconcerting and leg-wearying
fashion.</p>

<p>At last, when the whole party were out of
breath, and the Se&ntilde;orita quite exhausted, we
tottered on to the plateau on which the houses
were situated. The principal building, that in
the centre, was a long low affair surrounded, so
far as I could see, by a broad verandah; that to
the left was plainly the servants' quarters, while
the ramshackle huts, still further away, were
probably the dwellings of the native hands.
Crossing the open space, Manuel led us towards
the largest building. The place was much fallen
to decay, but it was still quite habitable. French
windows opened from the rooms into the verandah,
and towards one of these we were conducted.
Opening it, and standing in the entrance, he
signed to the President and the Se&ntilde;orita to pass
into the room. I followed them, and when he
had entered, he carefully closed the windows
after us. We found ourselves in a large room,
having a polished floor, whitewashed walls, and
a raftered roof, the latter without a ceiling. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
large table stood in the centre of the room, there
were half-a-dozen curious chairs scattered about,
while in the corner beside the door was a wicker-couch,
upon which a man was stretched out at
full length. One glance was sufficient to tell
me that he was Don Guzman de Silvestre, but so
changed that, had I not expected to see him, I
doubt if I should have recognized him. His face
was pinched and haggard, his eyes shone with an
unnatural brilliance, while his hands trembled
as if with the palsy.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Trevelyan, I congratulate you,"
he cried, as I entered the room. "You have
fulfilled your mission admirably." Then, turning
to his old enemy, he continued: "And so, my
dear Fernandez, we meet again, do we? It is
long since we last saw each other. But, stay,
who is the lady? What is she doing here?"</p>

<p>I gave him the necessary information, whereupon
he raised himself upon his couch.</p>

<p>"I am more than honoured," he remarked.
"I did not anticipate such a pleasure. I presume,
Trevelyan, you could not catch one without
the other? Was not that so?"</p>

<p>In reply, I admitted that it was, whereupon
he bade Manuel move a chair forward for the
Se&ntilde;orita, then, turning to Fernandez, he began
once more.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is certainly a long time since we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the pleasure of meeting," he said. "Let me see,
I wonder if I can recall the day. It was the
anniversary of the battle of Pladova, was it not?
I had arranged to preside at a banquet that
evening in celebration of the great event. You
called upon me in the morning, professing great
friendship. Prior to that you had undermined
all my officials, and had arranged that, at the
conclusion of the banquet, I was to be arrested,
whereupon you were to proclaim yourself
Dictator."</p>

<p>"I am glad to observe that, however poor your
health may be, your memory is as good as ever,"
Fernandez replied. "You have described the
situation exactly."</p>

<p>"Yes," Silvestre continued, "I have an excellent
memory! Unfortunately for your scheme,
however, I happened to hear of it in time.
At the last moment a sudden indisposition kept
me at the palace, and prevented my being
present at the dinner. So anxious were you
concerning the state of my health that you called
at the palace later to inquire after my welfare,
only to find that I had taken time by the forelock
and had effected my escape. It was a pity,
for I fancy you would have found it more profitable
to have shot me, and so have put me out of
harm's way at once."</p>

<p>"It certainly was rather a pity we could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
do so," said the President, "but you can have
your revenge now. What are your intentions
regarding myself?"</p>

<p>"I must take time to think that matter over,"
Silvestre replied. "The account I have to settle
with you is a long one, and I am not the man,
as you know, to do things in a hurry."</p>

<p>I saw the Se&ntilde;orita look at him with a light in
her eyes like that of a beautiful trapped animal.
She was trying to appear calm, but from the
way in which she laced and interlaced her fingers,
I could see the strain under which she was
labouring.</p>

<p>"If there is likely to be anything disagreeable,"
said Fernandez, "I should be glad if you
would get it over at once. Nothing is to be
gained by delaying matters."</p>

<p>"As I said just now, I must have time to
think it over," the other replied. "Upon one
thing, however, you can make up your mind,
you will never see Equinata again."</p>

<p>"At the present moment it certainly does not
seem very probable that I shall," Fernandez
answered, still with the same good-humour.
"And now with regard to another matter!
What are your intentions concerning this lady?"</p>

<p>He made a movement with his hands towards
the Se&ntilde;orita as he spoke.</p>

<p>"She shall, of course, be treated with all due<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
consideration and respect," Silvestre returned.
"Let that content you!"</p>

<p>He turned to Manuel, who was standing at the
window, and bade him call the guards into the
room. The latter accordingly made his way into
the verandah, and shouted something in a dialect
with which I was not familiar. In response to
his summons, four gigantic negroes, armed with
rifles (they had evidently been waiting somewhere
in the immediate vicinity) stalked into the room.
Without waiting for instructions, they took their
places on either side of Fernandez. My first fear
was that they were going to dispatch the ex-President
there and then. Silvestre must have
realized what was passing in my mind, for he
laughed and said:</p>

<p>"You need have no fear, my friend. I am
not going to do him any violence. Let him be
conveyed to the hut," he continued to Manuel,
"and be sure that the door is locked when you
come away. Place a sentry over him, and bring
me the key. Allow me to wish you good-evening,
Don Fernandez, and may pleasant dreams
attend your slumbers."</p>

<p>The Se&ntilde;orita had risen, and had taken a step
towards Silvestre. She tried to speak, but failed
in the attempt. At last she sank back in her
chair with an ashen face, and then Fernandez
was led away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trevelyan, my dear fellow, may I ask you to
be so good as to go to that door and clap your
hands twice," said Silvestre, when the other had
disappeared.</p>

<p>I did so, and after a few moments had elapsed
an elderly negress, whose curly hair was almost
snow-white, put in an appearance. In all my
experience of the African race I had never seen
so hideous a creature.</p>

<p>"Palmyre," Silvestre began, "take this lady
to a room and prepare it for her." Then to the
Se&ntilde;orita he continued: "If there is anything I can
do to promote your comfort, pray command me.
I deeply regret that my health is not sufficiently
good to permit of my attending to matters
myself. Doubtless you will be gracious enough
to take the will for the deed."</p>

<p>She did not answer, but followed Palmyre
from the room. When they had disappeared
Silvestre turned to me.</p>

<p>"You have managed the affair most excellently,
friend Helmsworth," he said. "I congratulate
you heartily. Now tell me exactly what happened.
Remember I have no knowledge of your
doings since we bade each other good-bye in
London."</p>

<p>I thereupon set to work and gave him a
description of my adventures.</p>

<p>"You certainly had a narrow escape of it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the cartel," he remarked when I had finished.
"Had Herma&ntilde;os not rescued you so opportunely,
Fernandez would have shot you without remorse.
I wish, however, that you had not been compelled
to bring the Se&ntilde;orita with you. But
perhaps it was for the best. If you had left her
behind, she would have made mischief. You
must have had a queer voyage with those two.
I wonder what your sweetheart in England would
have said, could she have looked in upon you?"</p>

<p>"We will leave her out of the question, if you
don't mind," I said quietly.</p>

<p>There was a time when I had liked and even
admired the man, but two or three things I
had heard during my stay in Equinata, and the
fiendish pleasure he had just taken in gibing at
his fallen enemy, had produced in me a feeling
that was very near akin to loathing.</p>

<p>"Don Guzman," I began, more seriously than
I had yet spoken, "I trust you will bear in mind
the promise you gave me in England!"</p>

<p>"And what promise was that?" he asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You gave me your most positive assurance
that no violence of any sort should be used
towards the man who is now in your power!"</p>

<p>"And I am not aware that I have said that
any violence would be used," he answered angrily.
"What makes you think that I want to harm<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
him? Didn't I tell you that my only desire is
to keep him out of harm's way until I have
once more grasped the reins of government in
Equinata? Your part of the business is finished,
and to-morrow I will pay you the reward I
promised you. Hand me up that quinine, there's
a good fellow. I've suffered agonies from this
cursed fever for the last three days. It's just
my luck to be struck down just at the moment
when it is necessary for me to be most active!"</p>

<p>I helped him to a dose of the medicine.</p>

<p>"Where will you live during the time you are
here?" he asked at last. "Ashore or on board
the yacht?"</p>

<p>"I should prefer the yacht if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you thought you could depend on my not
knocking those miserable beggars on the head
in the meantime, I suppose? Come, come," he
continued with a laugh, "if you go on like this,
I shall begin to think that the ex-President's
niece has proved herself more dangerous than
I at first imagined."</p>

<p>Then, doubtless seeing from my face that he
was venturing on dangerous ground, he made
haste to appease me.</p>

<p>"Don't take offence at a harmless jest, my
dear fellow," he said. "You know very well I
don't mean it."</p>

<p>Then, vowing that he was too ill to talk any<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
more just then, he bade me good-bye, promising
to see me on the morrow, if I would come up.
Before I went, however, I had a proposition
to make to him. I did not like to leave the
Se&ntilde;orita in his hands, so I begged that he would
allow her to return to the yacht, giving as an
excuse the plea that she would enjoy greater
comfort there.</p>

<p>"There is not the least necessity," he replied.
"She will be very well taken care of here. Just
for the present I prefer to have the lady under
my own eye. Sailors are impressionable beings,
and there is no telling what ideas she might put
into their heads. Remember me to Ferguson
and the others, and be sure to be up here by
eleven in the morning. Good-night!"</p>

<p>I thereupon left him and returned by the path
to the beach below. The niggers who had brought
us ashore had departed, so taking my boat-call
from my pocket I blew a shrill blast upon it.
They must have heard me on the yacht, for a
boat was immediately lowered and sent off to
fetch me. Arriving on board I went in search
of Ferguson, to whom I stated that I did not at
all like the look of things ashore. I communicated
to him my fear that Silvestre, in spite of
the assurance he had given me to the contrary,
contemplated doing some mischief to Fernandez.</p>

<p>"I should not be at all surprised if he did,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
my companion replied. "The two men have a
lot to settle between them, and Silvestre is
not the sort of man to forget or to forgive an
injury."</p>

<p>"But he gave me his word of honour, when I
undertook the task of getting the President out
of the country, that he only meant to keep him
locked up until all chance of his upsetting matters
in Equinata was past and done with."</p>

<p>"They say that promises, like pie-crust,"
Ferguson returned, "are made to be broken.
I wonder what Silvestre's promises are like?
Heigho! I shall be thankful when I have done
with the whole concern."</p>

<p>"And when do you think that will be?"</p>

<p>"When I have landed Don Guzman on the
mainland," he replied. "Then I have to take
this vessel back to a certain northern port, and
to hand her over to a man who is to meet her
there. After that, old England, and, if Allah
wills, a life of an entirely different description."</p>

<p>Next morning I returned to the house on the
hill, to find Silvestre's health much improved,
and his prisoners, as he found early occasion to
inform me, still alive.</p>

<p>"The lady," he said, "treated me to a pretty
specimen of her temper last night. She wouldn't
leave her room, and declined to eat her food.
Realizing that it was not the least use arguing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
with her, I left her to her own devices. Her
condition, I understand, has somewhat improved
this morning."</p>

<p>Presently he produced from his pocket a bundle
of bank-notes, which he handed to me.</p>

<p>"Here is the payment I promised you for your
work in Bank of England notes," he said. "Just
run your eye over them, will you, and see that
the amount is right?"</p>

<p>A few moments' investigation convinced me
that the notes in question amounted to the value
of five thousand pounds. As I dropped the
bundle into the inside pocket of my coat, I
reflected that it would be a big sum to carry
about with me continually. As I had no safer
place, however, I had to put up with it.</p>

<p>"And now there's a question I want to put
to you," I said. "My work is at an end, so
when will it be possible for me to leave for
England?"</p>

<p>"You can go when you like," he answered.
"You will find that I am prepared to stick to
my side of the contract as faithfully as you have
done to yours. Shall we say the day after
to-morrow? If that will suit you, the yacht
can take you across to Cuba, drop you on the
coast after dark, and you can then find your way
to Santiago, or elsewhere, as you please."</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow will suit me admirably,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
I replied. "As you may suppose, I
am all anxiety to get home. And when do <i>you</i>
propose sailing for Equinata?"</p>

<p>"When the yacht returns," he answered. "I
desire to get to business as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"And do you still think that you will be
successful in your enterprise?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked. "I have run the risk
before, and I am going to do so again. I've got
some powerful friends at my back, and with one
or two of my worst enemies, Fernandez and his
niece, for instance, out of the way, I am fairly
confident I shall be able to manage it. I suppose
it would be no use asking you to come with me?
I could make it worth your while to do so."</p>

<p>"I would not go with you for all the money
in the world," I answered. "I have had enough
of Equinata to last me a lifetime. I never want
to see the place again."</p>

<p>"Our tastes differ, I see; for I am as anxious
to settle there for the remainder of my existence
as you are to remain away from it."</p>

<p>That afternoon I went for a somewhat lengthy
stroll through the island. I was ill at ease, and
I wanted to make up my mind, if possible, as to
how I should act with regard to Fernandez and
the Se&ntilde;orita. Common humanity forbade that I
should callously leave the island and abandon
them to the fate I felt sure awaited them. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
how could I remain, and what good could I do
if I did so? I knew that in his heart Ferguson
was well disposed towards me, but even if he
were would he dare to interfere? And again,
if he did would the others take sides with us
or with Silvestre? By the time I reached the
beach once more I had come to no sort of decision.
For the time being I gave the matter up as a bad
job. I was in the act of stepping into the boat
that was to take me on board, when a shout from
the wood behind attracted my attention. It
emanated from Ferguson. When he reached the
boat I noticed that he was deathly pale, and that
there was a look in his eyes I had never seen
there before.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked. "You look
as if you had seen a ghost!"</p>

<p>"Hush! I'll tell you when we get on board,"
he replied. "It would be impossible to do so
now."</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">[Pg 213]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Of one thing you may be sure; that was the
fact that I was more than anxious to hear what
Ferguson had to tell me. That the man was
very much upset I could see, while the hint he
had given me in the boat, concerning certain
tidings he had to tell me, frightened me beyond
measure. Immediately on reaching the yacht
I took him to the saloon and poured him out a
stiff glass of grog. He drank it off, and when
he had done so, seemed the better for it.</p>

<p>"Now come along to the chart-room," I said,
"and let me hear what you have to say. We
shall be alone there, and I gathered from your
manner that what you have to tell me will not
bear the presence of eavesdroppers."</p>

<p>"Come along then," he replied. "Let us go
up there at once, I shall not rest happy until
I have shared this with you."</p>

<p>We accordingly left the saloon and ascended
to the bridge. Once in the chart-room, and
when we had shut the door carefully behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
us, I seated myself on the chart locker, while
Ferguson took possession of the couch.</p>

<p>"Now then, go ahead," I said. "What have
you discovered?"</p>

<p>"It's the most fiendish plot I ever heard of,"
he replied. "I would not have believed a man
could have thought of anything so vile. If I
had not chanced to stray where I did no one
would have been the wiser. And then&mdash;&mdash;"
He stopped abruptly, as if the thought were
too much for him.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me yet what it is
you have heard," I continued, with some sort
of impatience.</p>

<p>He rose and went to the door, opened it,
looked outside, and then returned once more
to his place on the couch.</p>

<p>"This afternoon, as you know," he began,
leaning forward on his seat, as if he were desirous
that no one but myself should hear, "I went
ashore to see Silvestre. He was anxious, he said,
to consult me concerning the business of taking
you to Cuba, and also about the landing of himself
and the others on the Equinata coast. I had a
long talk with him, during which he was all
graciousness and condescension. Butter wouldn't
have melted in his mouth. He praised all the
services we had rendered him. You can have
no idea how pleasant he was. When he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
President, I was to have command, if I wished
it, of an Equinata man-o'-war, etc., and above
all others I was to be his trusted naval adviser.
No post could be too big for me."</p>

<p>"It sounds very nice, but he also endeavoured
to advise me to return with him," I said.</p>

<p>"And what reply did you give him?" Ferguson
inquired.</p>

<p>"I gave him to understand that I would not
go back to Equinata for all the money in the
world," I said. "I had had quite enough of the
place to last me a lifetime."</p>

<p>"That was my reply exactly," Ferguson replied.
"The next time they see me there of my own
free will, they may treat me as they please."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that, continue your story,"
I returned. "What is it you have discovered?"</p>

<p>"Well, after I left Silvestre, I had the misfortune&mdash;or
the good fortune&mdash;as you may consider
it, to miss my way. How I came to do so I
am unable to say. It is sufficient that I did.
You know how thick the jungle is up there!
Well! instead of taking the track that brings
one down to where we embark, I branched off to
the left, and found myself stranded in as thick a
bit of scrub as ever I have seen in my life. It
was hot enough to roast the scalp on your head,
and I was just beginning to think of turning
back, when I heard a voice come from thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
bushes on my right. 'Hulloa, what on earth is
he doing there?' I said to myself, for I recognized
it as belonging to Manuel, the half-caste. The
words I heard him utter made me more than a
bit suspicious."</p>

<p>"What was it he said?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"'You can do it easily, nobody will ever find
out,'" Ferguson replied. "'But I can't, I can't,'
a woman's voice answered. It was old Palmyre,
the negress, who spoke. 'You'd better do it, or
he'll cut your throat as he would a pig's,' Manuel
continued. 'Why do you argue about the matter?
You know very well that you are out here gathering
the herbs yourself.' 'But their spirits will
haunt me,' cried the old woman. That made
me all attention, you may be sure. The
half-caste uttered an oath in reply. The spirit
that would haunt him would have to be a fairly
potent one. 'What does it matter,' he went on;
'you will be well paid for it.' For a few seconds
nothing more was said, but as I listened I heard
something that sounded very like a sob. Whatever
he was trying to persuade the old negress
to do, it was very plain that she did not relish
the job. Presently she whispered, 'When must
it be done?' 'As soon as Silvestre leaves in
the yacht,' the other replied. 'What difficulty is
there in it? All you have to do is to stew the
herbs and to slip them into their food. You'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a rich woman for the rest of your life.' After that
they moved further away from me, and I came
down to the boat."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I cried, the awful truth
coming to me in a flash. "Silvestre intends to
poison them."</p>

<p>"There is not much doubt about that," said
Ferguson. "When you are out of the way
and he has left for Equinata, the Se&ntilde;orita and
President will never trouble him or any one else
again. And as far as I can see nothing can save
them!"</p>

<p>"It's too horrible! It's devilish," I cried,
springing to my feet. "He took his oath to
me that not a hair of their heads should be
harmed."</p>

<p>"He wished you to take his words literally,
you see," Ferguson returned. "He said nothing
about giving each of them a dose of poison.
Look at the matter from his point of view. As
long as they live they are his enemies and he
is not safe. He owes Fernandez a deadly grudge
and he means to pay it."</p>

<p>"But what is to be done? We cannot let
them be murdered in cold blood. Human nature
couldn't stand that. And yet if he knows that
we are aware of his plot, he will take means to
prevent our interfering and kill them out of
hand. For God's sake, Ferguson, advise me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see exactly what we can do," he
replied sorrowfully. "Silvestre has got us in
a cleft stick and we can't help ourselves."</p>

<p>"But surely you are not going to stand by
and allow him to carry out his fiendish plot?"
I returned hotly. "I can't believe that of
you!"</p>

<p>"But you don't know what Silvestre is," said
Ferguson, not daring to meet my eyes. "It
would be madness to thwart him."</p>

<p>"If I don't know what he is," I retorted, "I
at least know what I am. I brought these
unfortunate people here. He shall not harm
them, if it costs me all I have on earth, even
life itself. And what is more, if you're a man
you'll help me."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" he answered helplessly.
"I have always been considered a fairly plucky
fellow. I must confess, however, that this business
is too much for me. I've a wife and family
to think of, you know!"</p>

<p>"Your wife would despise you above all living
men if she knew that you were a party to the
murder of that woman," I answered.</p>

<p>He scratched his chin and looked at me in a
perplexed way. It was evident to me that I
must not expect very much assistance from him.</p>

<p>"To my mind a man ought to think of his
wife and children before anything else," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at last, in a tone of apology. "If anything
happens to me what is to become of them? I'm
beginning to think I was a fool to have told you
anything about it!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I answered. "There, at
least, you did an honest action. Don't spoil it
by drawing back."</p>

<p>This only elicited his old query.</p>

<p>"But what can we do?"</p>

<p>"We must get them out of the island before
Silvestre can do them a mischief," I replied.</p>

<p>"And pray how is that to be done?"</p>

<p>"A way must be found," I answered. "Surely
it should not be so very difficult. Remember,
Ferguson, I did you a good turn once. Repay
it now by helping me to save them. If they die,
their deaths will be at our doors. For my part,
if that happens I shall never know a moment's
peace again, or be able to look an honest man
or woman in the face. I worked for Silvestre
because I had given him my promise to do so,
and had taken his money; he has repaid it by
breaking his oath to me. By jove! whether I
am bound to him or not, I will prevent him from
carrying out this terrible crime."</p>

<p>I could see that, and also realized, that
whatever Ferguson's desire might be to help
me, he was not willing to run any great risks
himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must have time to think it over," he said.
"In the meantime keep your own counsel. If a
hint of this gets about we are done for."</p>

<p>I did not reply, but left him and went below
to my cabin, where I threw myself down on my
bunk and set to work to try and think the question
out. What a fool I had been to mix myself up
in the matter at all. One moment's thought
should have told me that Silvestre was not the
sort of man to have any mercy upon his enemy.
A dozen plans for effecting the escape of the
President and Se&ntilde;orita formed themselves in my
mind, only to be thrown aside at once as useless.
Then the gong sounded for dinner and I made
my way to the saloon. I had just set foot inside
the companion, when a voice I knew so well, and
had now learned to hate, greeted me.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, my friend," said Silvestre
cheerily. "I have come aboard to be your guest
this evening. As my fever has left me, I thought
a little sea air and congenial society would do me
no harm. Shall we go in to dinner?"</p>

<p>For a moment I was so surprised at seeing
him that I could not answer. I followed him,
however, to the saloon, where I found that
three places had been laid. A few minutes later
Ferguson made his appearance and we sat down
to our meal. As we did so I shot a glance at
the other's face. It was plain from the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
upon it that Silvestre's presence had
alarmed him considerably.</p>

<p>"We should really have invited the Se&ntilde;orita
to join us," said Silvestre, as he spread his
serviette over his knees. "Se&ntilde;or Fernandez, I
regret to say, is suffering from a slight attack
of fever to-day. I have prescribed for him,
however, and trust he will be himself shortly."</p>

<p>As he said this I glanced sharply at him.
Was he commencing his awful crime already?
The mere thought of it was sufficient to take my
appetite away. Had I been able to follow my
own inclinations, I should have laid down my
knife and fork and have risen from the table
without touching another morsel. Prudence,
however, bade me remain where I was. I shot
a glance at Ferguson, to find him wiping his
face with his handkerchief. Silvestre was also
watching him.</p>

<p>"The evening is very hot," said the captain,
by way of excuse, "very hot indeed."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," Silvestre returned dryly.
"If I am not mistaken, we shall have a thunderstorm
later."</p>

<p>During the remainder of the repast Silvestre
continued to converse in very much his usual
fashion. He did not refer again, however, to the
prisoners. At ten o'clock he left for the shore,
but before he did so, he bade me be ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
start for Cuba on the following afternoon. I
tried to invent an excuse for remaining longer,
but one would not come to my hand.</p>

<p>"Needless to say I am anxious to get on to
Equinata with all dispatch," said Silvestre. "I
cannot do so until I have carried out my promise
to you."</p>

<p>"Why not go first and let the yacht come back
for me?" I suggested. "I am in no particular
hurry."</p>

<p>"I could not dream of such a thing," he
answered politely. "It would be better for you
to go at once. Indeed, I have this evening given
the necessary instructions to Ferguson."</p>

<p>After that there was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>As he went down the accommodation ladder
an idea occurred to me. His boat was not more
than a dozen lengths from the yacht's side before
I had made my way up the ladder to the
bridge and had entered the chart-room. Above
the chart-locker was a shelf on which were kept
the books of reference needful for the navigation
of the yacht. In a fever of impatience I ran
my eye along them until I came upon the
volume I wanted. To consult the index and
discover a certain island was a question of a few
moments. I read what the book had to say
regarding it, but I was not greatly relieved
by so doing. Communication with the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
was evidently only a matter of chance. I
thereupon took the chart of that particular part
of the Carribean Sea and studied it attentively.
The nearest island to San Diaz was that of
Asturia, distant something like a day and a half's
steam. It was comforting to learn that numerous
trading boats touched there. Let me go at once,
as Silvestre had proposed, and, instead of proceeding
to Cuba, induce Ferguson to put into
this island. If luck favoured me, I could charter
a vessel there and return to San Diaz to rescue
the President and the Se&ntilde;orita. Having once
thought of this plan, I was eager to put it
into execution. I determined, however, to say
nothing to Ferguson until the morrow, and only
then when we were well out at sea. Friendly
though the little man was to me, I had seen
enough of him to feel sure that it would need
but little pressure from Silvestre to undermine
that friendship.</p>

<p>Next morning I left the yacht and went
ashore to bid Silvestre farewell. I could very
well have dispensed with this ceremony, but I
was afraid of arousing his suspicions. I found
him seated in the verandah of his house when I
arrived, a cigar in his mouth, and a book in his
hand. He greeted me pleasantly enough. As
I looked at him I could not help recalling the
evening when I had seen him seated in the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
summerhouse of the inn at Falstead. How many
things had happened since that memorable afternoon!</p>

<p>He rose to receive me and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether we shall ever see each
other again, Helmsworth?" he said, when I had
seated myself. "You have done me a great
service, and in the name of the people of
Equinata I thank you for it. You will return
to Falstead at once, I suppose," he went on, after
a short pause, "marry the girl of your heart, and
settle down to shire life. I wonder what my
fate will be?"</p>

<p>I thought that if Fernandez managed to
escape, I could hazard a very good guess.
Before leaving him I touched upon the old
subject, in order to see what his reply would be.</p>

<p>"I presume you will not permit me to say
farewell to your prisoners," I said.</p>

<p>"It would not be wise," he answered.
"Fernandez, as I told you last night, is down
with fever, and the Se&ntilde;orita is not in the best of
tempers just now. However, I will convey all
sorts of kind messages to them from you when
next I see them."</p>

<p>I rose from my chair.</p>

<p>"Don Guzman," I began, trying to speak
calmly, "you are not playing me false, are you?
If any harm should befall Fernandez and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
niece, remember you will have all Civilization
against you."</p>

<p>At this he fairly lost his temper.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios</i>, man," he cried, "do you
want to make me angry with you? Why do you
harp so continually on this string? I have told
you, and reiterated the fact, that I do not intend
to harm them. If I did, don't you think I
should have done so ere this? What's more,
Mr. Helmsworth, let me just give you a word
of advice. When you return to England, be
sure you keep a silent tongue in your head. I
can be a good friend, and a particularly bitter
enemy. I've a long arm, and when I strike I
strike deep. But there, my dear fellow, don't
let us quarrel at the time we're about to say
farewell to each other. We must part friends.
Is it time for you to go? Then good-bye, and
may good fortune go with you."</p>

<p>When I left him I made my way towards the
path leading to the beach. As I crossed the
open space in front of the house, I turned my
eyes in the direction of the hut where Fernandez
was confined. One of the gigantic negroes that
I had seen on the day of our arrival at the island
was standing on guard, rifle in hand, before it.
Silvestre, I knew, was watching me from the
verandah, so there was no chance of being able<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to communicate with the prisoner. I accordingly
continued my walk down to the beach. Two
hours later the yacht was steaming out of
harbour, and so far as Silvestre knew, I was on
my way to England <i>vi&acirc;</i> Cuba.</p>

<p>As I have already observed, it is a day and a
half's steam from San Diaz to the nearest island&mdash;Asturia.
The latter is, if anything, slightly
bigger than its neighbour. It is certainly more
prosperous. Lying in the track of ships it has
a number of visitors, and trade is consequently
fairly brisk&mdash;the principal exports being a peculiar
species of hard wood, and a small quantity
of sugar, for which product the soil is well
adapted.</p>

<p>It was not until we had been several hours at
sea that I broached the subject that was uppermost
in my mind to Ferguson. For reasons
already stated I was by no means certain how
he would receive it. Would his friendship for
myself be sufficiently strong to stand the test?
However, the matter had to be decided, one way
or the other, and what was more there was no
time to be lost. I accordingly took advantage
of the opportunity that presented itself, and
came to business. He heard me out in silence,
but there was an expression upon his face that
told me he was not particularly in love with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
proposal. Indeed, between ourselves, I don't
see how he could have been.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Helmsworth Trevelyan, or
Trevelyan Helmsworth&mdash;whatever you please to
call yourself&mdash;as I understand it you are asking
me to do a thing I have never done before. In
other words you are asking me to go back upon
the man whose money I am taking."</p>

<p>"Oh! come, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just one moment before you reply. Let me
put it in my own way, and you can work it out
as you like afterwards. I can't see for myself
that there is any other construction to be placed
upon your proposal. You'll admit, I suppose,
that Silvestre is my employer? I am here to
run this boat according to his orders, and my
instructions are to take you to Cuba and to land
you there. You want me to disregard them, and
to drop you at Asturia."</p>

<p>"But surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold hard until I have finished. You know
that I'm not a particular squeamish fellow. I've
done a good many things that a number of
people wouldn't even look at; but&mdash;and mark
you this 'but' is fairly important, if I've got
to choose between you and Silvestre&mdash;friendship
steps in and Silvestre goes to the wall. At the
same time I don't mind confessing that it's far<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
from a nice position you have placed me in.
The world won't be big enough for me to hide in
when it comes to getting away from Silvestre.
And when you come to think I've a wife and
family at home all depending upon me, I'll leave
you to figure out how much you value Fernandez'
life at."</p>

<p>This was a way of looking at the question that
I had not foreseen.</p>

<p>"But I cannot go away and leave the man
there to be murdered," I began. "Flesh and
blood wouldn't allow that."</p>

<p>"Very well, then let us say no more about it.
It's settled that I run into Asturia and that you
go ashore there."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"I shall go on to Cuba!"</p>

<p>"Give me all the time you can," I said.
"I've a big bit of work before me when I get
back to the island."</p>

<p>"And I wish you joy of it."</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when we reached the
island. I was anxious, however, to lose no time,
and determined to land at once. Immediately
on dropping anchor, therefore, I asked Ferguson
to put me ashore. This he willingly consented
to do, and in due course I found myself with
my baggage on the beach. When I had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the boat depart, I made my way into the town.
It was a queer little place, built on the side
of a hill, and with, so far as I could see, a
very sparse white population.</p>

<p>From a negro boy I inquired my way to the
principal hotel, if there should happen to be
more than one. He grinned expansively and
offered to conduct me to it. It proved to be
only a short distance away and faced the sea-front.
I rewarded the boy, entered it, and made
my way into the bar. The landlord was a
Spaniard, and about as villainous a specimen of
his race as I'd ever seen. I told him I had just
arrived, and that I was anxious to charter a
schooner at once, and inquired whether he could
help me in the matter, promising to reward
him liberally should he do so.</p>

<p>As it happened, he declared that he knew of
exactly the sort of vessel I wanted. I inquired
the owner's name and asked the landlord where
she could be seen.</p>

<p>"She's anchored about a couple of cables from
the pier, se&ntilde;or," he replied, "and she is the property
of my good friend, Maxime Blonde. Maxime
was lamenting to me only this evening that,
having no cargo, he must return to Martinique
empty."</p>

<p>"Where can I find him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"On board, se&ntilde;or." Then, scenting business,
he continued: "If you wish it, I will escort you
to him."</p>

<p>To this I willingly agreed, and then, when he
had called his wife to take charge of the saloon,
and a negro to accompany him, we made our
way to the pier. A boat was soon discovered,
and in her, rowed by the negro, we set off for
the <i>La Belle Josephine</i> of Martinique.</p>

<p>She proved to be a small fore-and-aft schooner
of about fifty tons, nattily built, so far as I
was able to judge in the darkness, and very
well suited to my purpose.</p>

<p>"Maxime, Maxime Blonde," screeched the
hotel keeper, "a se&ntilde;or to see you on business.
Come forth!"</p>

<p>"What now?" cried a voice from the cabin
aft. "Who is it calls Maxime at this time of
night?"</p>

<p>The hotel keeper went aft and explained
matters. Presently he returned and invited me
to follow him to the cabin. Of all the dirty
holes it has been my misfortune to enter this
was certainly the worst. Straw, paper, and
banana peel littered the floor. On the right-hand
side of the cabin was a narrow bunk, upon which
a small, shrivelled-up mulatto was seated. He
explained that he was Monsieur Maxime, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
that he was owner and captain of the vessel.
Being unable to bear the closeness of the cabin I
suggested that we should do our business on
deck, and thither the little man followed me.
In something under a quarter of an hour my
arrangements were made with him, and it was
settled that we should sail for San Diaz at daybreak.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">[Pg 232]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Of our voyage from the island of Asturia to
San Diaz there is little to chronicle. <i>La Belle
Josephine</i>, as far as her sailing capabilities were
concerned, was all that her owner and captain
had described her to be. On the other hand, her
dirt and slovenliness were exactly what I had
been led to expect it would be from my first
inspection of the cabin. To sleep in it, or to
eat my meals there, was out of the question.
How the Se&ntilde;orita would manage, when she came
aboard&mdash;provided I was able to get her away
from the island&mdash;I could not imagine.</p>

<p>Monsieur Maxime's navigation, I soon discovered,
was of the most elementary description.
However, perhaps by luck, and perhaps by a
measure of good judgment, he managed to pick
up the island about noon on the third day after
leaving Asturia.</p>

<p>Fearing that Silvestre might have some one on
the look-out, I bade Maxime keep the schooner
out of sight of land until nightfall. Then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
put in, and brought up in a small bay some five
miles from the settlement. Immediately it was
dark I went ashore, bidding the hands take the
boat back, and when they got there to keep a
sharp ear for my whistle.</p>

<p>Fortunately for what I had in hand, it was a
dark night, so dark indeed that I could scarcely
see the boat when I had walked a dozen paces
from it. What the jungle would be like I could
not imagine.</p>

<p>When the boat had disappeared I set off along
the beach in the direction of the settlement.
How I was going to reach the house without
attracting the attention of its inmates, and what
I was going to do when I got there, were two
points about which I did not trouble myself very
much at that time. My lucky star had so far
been in the ascendant, that I was trusting to it
to continue so. I knew very well that it was a
desperate enterprise I was embarking upon, for
should Silvestre discover me, my shrift was
likely to be as short as that which Fernandez
had so obligingly arranged for me in La Gloria.
At last, when I reached the eastern side of the
bay, that in which the yacht had anchored, I turned
towards the jungle and prepared to enter it. I
knew I was in for some hard work, but I did
not imagine that it would prove so difficult as I
found it to be. The dense mass of creeper that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
twined from tree to tree barred my progress at
every step. I had to climb, to twist, to crawl,
in places unable to see more than a few inches
ahead, scratched by aloes and thorny bushes,
buffeted by low branches, and more than once
tripped up and thrown heavily to the ground by
logs and other obstacles. How long it took me
to reach the plateau I cannot say, but I could
scarcely have been less than an hour upon the
road. Yet the distance was certainly not more
than a quarter of a mile. Somewhat to my
astonishment the plateau was all darkness; not
a light showed from the house, not a sound came
from the huts. With a stealth that would have
done credit to a Sioux or an Apache, I crept
through the bushes towards the block-house in
which Fernandez had been confined when I had
left the island. A sudden fear had come over me
that, during my absence, Silvestre might have
done away with him. If no sentry stood at the
door I should believe this to be the case. Closer
and still closer I crept to it. At last I was only
a few yards distant from it. I was about to
move forward on my hands and knees in order
to obtain a better view, when a guttural cough
reached me, coming, so it seemed, from only a
few yards away. So close was it, indeed, that I
sprang back, fearing lest the man who uttered it
would become aware of my presence. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
grounding of a rifle-butt on the stones before
the hut door reached me, and afforded me indisputable
evidence that the general was still
imprisoned there.</p>

<p>At first a wild notion came into my head that
I might be able to overpower the negro sentry,
and, having done so, to free Fernandez. A
moment's reflection, however, told me that in
all probability he would prove more than a match
for me, while he might also have time to fire his
rifle and so to give the alarm. More important
still, even if I did have the good luck to overcome
him, I should not be able to get into the hut, as
Silvestre kept the key.</p>

<p>"No," I said to myself, "I must try again
to-morrow night, and then I'll bring the two
men with me."</p>

<p>Creeping back as carefully as I had come, I
reached the beach once more as tired as if I
had walked a dozen miles through heavy ground.
Going to the water's edge, I gave a shrill whistle,
and then sat myself down to await the boat's
arrival. It was not long in coming, and in less
than a quarter of an hour I was back on board
the schooner. Calling up Monsieur Maxime, I
bade him get sail on her and put to sea once
more. He seemed a little surprised, I fancy,
and was about to demur. A brief remonstrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
on my part, however, sufficed to put him on
good terms with me again.</p>

<p>The next day was spent out of sight of the
island, but as soon as darkness fell we were back
once more and anchored in the bay. By this
time, as you may suppose, I had perfected my
scheme as far as possible, and knew exactly what
I was going to do.</p>

<p>To my delight the night proved as dark as
its predecessor. When, after some difficulty, I
reached the shore, with the two men who had
volunteered to assist me, the wind was driving
the sand upon the beach in clouds, and was
howling most dismally among the trees of the
jungle.</p>

<p>"We couldn't have chosen a better night," I
said to my companions, as we hurried along.
"With the elements in our favour, however, we
shall have to be very careful how we act."</p>

<p>We made our way down the beach as I had
done on the previous night, and climbed the hill
as before. Neither of the men had had any
previous experience of jungle-work, but they
were to have some now which would be sufficient
to last them all their lives. More than once
they followed my example and went sprawling
in the darkness, while once the taller of the
pair managed to get his foot entangled in a mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of creeper, and it required all my efforts, and
those of his companion, to release him.</p>

<p>"Lord bless us, sir," the other whispered in
my ear, "I hope there are no snakes about.
This seems just the sort of place to find them."</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid," I replied. "I have
been assured that there is not a snake on the
island."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," I heard him mutter. "I
don't cotton to snakes nohow."</p>

<p>At last we reached the plateau, whereupon I
bade both men remain where they were while I
went to reconnoitre. Then, dropping on to my
hands and knees, I crept forward until I was
on the edge of the jungle. It was the same
place from which I had watched the sentry on
the previous night. Either he or one of his
comrades was there now, for I could just see
his dark figure standing at the corner of the hut.
Across the plateau streamed a bright light from
the sitting-room of the house, while the faint
tinkling of some native instrument reached my
ears from the group of huts beyond. Having
taken my observations, I crept back again to
my companions.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, I had already instructed
them in their duties. In consequence, each had
brought with him a hank of thin rope, while I
had placed two or three carefully made canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
gags in my pocket in case their services should be
required. The idea I had in my mind was that
we should creep up to the hut from behind. The
two men would then take the right-hand side and
make their way round the building with as little
noise as possible, while I was to imitate them on
the left. When I reached the sentry I was to
saunter slowly up to him as if it were the most
natural thing in the world for me to be there.
Before he could recover from his astonishment at
seeing me, they were to spring upon him and
make him secure&mdash;I obtaining possession of his
rifle before he could fire it.</p>

<p>"Come along," I whispered, "and don't make
a sound as you love your lives."</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, I led them from
the jungle and across the open space that
separated us from the hut. Having gained its
shelter, we paused to prepare for the struggle.</p>

<p>Since I had left England I had been in
some tight places, but I had never felt so
nervous as I did at that moment. There was
so much to be thought of, so much to be
provided for, and yet so much to be left to
chance. What if the sentry did not prove as
surprised as I hoped he would be? Suppose the
men did not come up in time and gave him an
opportunity of discharging his rifle, what would
our fate be then? But it did not improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
matters thinking of what might happen. I had
to carry out my portion of the scheme and
leave the rest to Fate. So, having seen the
men ready with their ropes in their hands, I
calmly strolled round the side of the hut towards
the spot where the sentry was standing.
It seemed to me that on the outcome of those
few steps I was staking all that was worth
having in the world&mdash;Molly's happiness, my
mother's, Fernandez' and the Se&ntilde;orita Dolores'
lives, and in all probability my own. Then I
turned the corner and the giant figure of the
negro was before me. He looked up and saw
me, uttered an exclamation of surprise, and then
took a step forward as if to make sure of my
identity.</p>

<p>"Have you a light for my cigar, friend?" I
inquired, as coolly as I could force myself to speak.</p>

<p>As I said it the two figures of my companions
appeared round the further corner.
Before the man could reply they had thrown
themselves upon him; one had clutched him by
the throat, while the other pinioned his hands
behind him. Springing forward, I seized the rifle
he had dropped. The man made a desperate
struggle for his liberty, but we were too much
for him, and almost before he could realize what
had happened, we had got him on the other side
of the hut, where we could make him secure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
do with him as we might think best. In almost
less time than it takes to tell, my two companions
had lashed him so securely that it was
impossible for him to move hand or foot or,
what was more important still, to cry out.</p>

<p class="caption">&quot;One had clutched him by the throat.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>"So far so good," I said, rising from my knees,
where I had been kneeling beside the prostrate
man. "He will give us no more trouble. Now
you, Williams, take his rifle and stand sentry in
front of that door, while Matthews and I go
across to the house and see what we can do
with Silvestre. We've got to find that key
somehow."</p>

<p>Williams took the rifle and proceeded to the
front of the hut, where he stood in very much
the same attitude as the negro had adopted.
Then Matthews and I, in our turn, made our way
quietly back to the jungle, and through it towards
the spot where it approached nearest the
house. The light was still streaming from
Silvestre's window, and once, as we waited, I
heard the sound of his laugh. It was evident
from this that he was not alone.</p>

<p>"Now, Matthews," I said, "what we have to
do is to get across to that verandah without any
one seeing us. If we are caught, remember our
lives will pay the penalty."</p>

<p>"I hope we shan't be caught then, sir," the
man replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was as still as the grave; the music
had ceased at the huts, and not a sound came
from the house towards which we were making
our way. At last we reached the verandah
and ascended the two steps that led up to it.
Silvestre's sitting-room was now only a few yards
distant. Would it be possible for us to reach it
without giving him warning of our approach?
Fortunately for us, the floor of the verandah was
of earth, beaten hard, and for this reason, unless
we were more than usually careless, the odds
were in our favour. Keeping as close to the
wall of the house as possible, we approached the
window, which was open. As we did so, Silvestre
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Well, I have given you plenty of time to
think it over," he remarked. "What have you
to say?"</p>

<p>"Only that I refuse," the Se&ntilde;orita replied, for
she was his companion. "You could not expect
me to do anything else."</p>

<p>"Think well what you are doing," the other
continued, and as he said it I advanced a couple
of steps. "You know that when I say a thing
I mean it. I tell you plainly Fernandez' life
is not worth an hour's purchase. He chose to
come between me and my ambition, and I have
tossed him aside as I should have done a straw.
When he is out of the way Equinata will listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to me, and when she has observed how I deal
with such as oppose me, I don't think she will
make any more mistakes. I know that you are
dangerous, but I fancy I can manage you. Give
me the information I require, and I'll spare you
and perhaps do more. Why should you bother
yourself about Fernandez?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I have no heart?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you have about as much as
any other woman," was the sneering reply.
"Come, Se&ntilde;orita, you must admit that my
patience has held out pretty well. But you
mustn't overstrain it. Give me the information
I require and I, on my side, will pledge myself
to send you to Europe, and also to allow
Fernandez to remain here in safety, provided he
passes his word never to return to Equinata or
to molest me further. I cannot make you a
fairer offer than that, and I am afraid I am
foolish to do so much."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse to accept your terms?"</p>

<p>"Then I shoot Fernandez at daybreak, and
when the yacht returns sail away, leaving you
here in Palmyre's charge. I am afraid you
would find the life a trifle lonely after La Gloria."</p>

<p>Knowing as I did what his real intentions
were, I was able to form a very fair estimate of
the man's villainy. What the information could
be that he was so anxious to obtain from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
I could not imagine. I had not much time,
however, to think about it, for as the thought
flashed through my brain I heard some one
rise from a chair and cross the room, then
Silvestre's voice continued, in a more persuasive
tone than he had used before: "Se&ntilde;orita, you
and I together could govern that country as it
has never been ruled before. I know who are
my friends there, and I am also acquainted with
my enemies. The first I shall take care to render
even more loyal than they were before, the others
I shall deal with in such a fashion that they will
give no more trouble. Come, make up your
mind. Go home to Europe for a year until I
have everything in order and then come out and
join me. Who knows what happiness may be
in store for us? What have you to say to my
proposal?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," she answered in a heart-broken
voice; "and yet, oh Heaven! I cannot let you
kill him."</p>

<p>"You must decide one way or the other," he
said remorselessly, "and you'd also better be
quick about it. My patience is well nigh
exhausted."</p>

<p>There was another interval of silence.</p>

<p>"Will you let me see Se&ntilde;or Fernandez for
a moment before I give you my answer?" she
pleaded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for an instant," he replied. "You must
have known what answer I should give you when
you put the question. I know Se&ntilde;or Fernandez
too well to allow you two to meet. I see it is
half-past ten! Now I will give you five minutes
in which to make up your mind, and if you don't
tell me what I want to know then, I will carry
out my threat and Fernandez will finish his
career at daybreak."</p>

<p>She uttered a piteous little cry, followed by
an appeal for mercy.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me of mercy," he answered.
"What mercy did he show me? What mercy
would he have for me if our positions were
reversed? He would have shot me like a dog.
Bear the fact in mind, Se&ntilde;orita, that if he comes
to an untimely end you will be responsible for
it!"</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>"Time is flying. You have only four minutes
left!"</p>

<p>It was impossible that I could listen to this
sort of talk unmoved. He had the unfortunate
woman at his mercy, and I knew him well
enough by this time to feel convinced that as
soon as he had extracted his information from
her he would throw his promises to the wind,
and carry out the infamous project of which
Manuel had spoken to Palmyre. He knew well<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
that even if he killed Fernandez and allowed her
to go free she would begin to intrigue against
him. His insinuation that she should return
from Europe to him in Equinata was only a subterfuge
to prevent her becoming suspicious as to
his real intentions.</p>

<p>"Three minutes gone!"</p>

<p>The Se&ntilde;orita said nothing in reply, but although
I could not see her I could very well
imagine the agony she was suffering. The memory
of the night we had spent together in the
balcony of the Opera House at La Gloria came
back to me. Then I took my revolver from my
pocket, and gave the magazine a turn to see that
it was in working order.</p>

<p>Once more Silvestre spoke.</p>

<p>"Time is up," he said. "I will call Palmyre
and give the necessary orders about Fernandez."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried in the expostulation of
despair. "Take my life&mdash;kill me! But for the
Blessed Virgin's sake, let him go free."</p>

<p>"Will you give me the information?" was
Silvestre's reply.</p>

<p>The Se&ntilde;orita uttered a little cry as if she were
suffering physical pain.</p>

<p>"And send them to their deaths? No, no, I
should be less than human if I were to do
that."</p>

<p>"Fernandez will be less than human if you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
not," was the other's brutal response. "Permit
me, and I will call Palmyre."</p>

<p>As he said this, I turned to the man behind
me and signalled that I was about to enter the
room. Then, revolver in hand, I strode in.</p>

<p>"That will do, Silvestre," I cried, covering
him with the revolver as I approached him.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! you here?" he shouted, as if
he found it difficult to believe the evidence of
his own eyes. The Se&ntilde;orita was leaning against
the table with a look of bewildered astonishment
upon her face.</p>

<p>"As you see, I have returned," I answered.
"But I have not time to discuss that matter with
you now. I give you fair warning that if you
speak again I shall shoot. Sit down in that
chair and put your hands behind you!"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/gs04b.png" width="382" height="600" alt="&quot;&#39;I give you fair warning that if you speak again I shall shoot.&#39;&quot;" />
<p class="caption">&quot;&#39;I give you fair warning that if you speak again I shall shoot.&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>With an oath Silvestre complied with my
request.</p>

<p>Turning to Matthews, I signed to him to carry
out the work we had previously arranged. In
less time than it takes to tell, Don Guzman de
Silvestre was securely fastened in his chair, a gag
had been placed in his mouth, and it was then
out of his power to do any mischief. From the
expression upon his face I could gather some
notion of what his feelings were. It was very
evident that if I should have the misfortune to
fall into his hands again I should be likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
receive but little mercy from him. As soon as
he was secure, and I had abstracted the key of
the block-house from his pocket, I turned to
the lady.</p>

<p>"Come, Se&ntilde;orita," I whispered, "you had
better prepare for departure. If we are to release
the President and to get away before daylight
there is not much time to be lost."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready to leave," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then be good enough to accompany this
man, and be very careful to keep in the shadow
of the house," I returned. "Above all, see that
you do not make a sound. I want to have a few
words alone with Silvestre."</p>

<p>Matthews led the way from the room and,
with one last look at the man in the chair, the
Se&ntilde;orita followed him.</p>

<p>When I had seen her turn the corner of the
verandah, I approached Silvestre, who glared at
me as though he hoped the fire in his eyes might
consume me.</p>

<p>"Don Guzman," I began, speaking in a low
voice, "before I take leave of you, I want to let
you know why I have played this trick upon
you. You will remember that at Falstead you
gave me your assurance that if I helped you
to secure Fernandez you would do him no
harm. And yet you have given orders that, as
soon as you had left the island for Equinata, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Se&ntilde;orita and her uncle were to be poisoned. I
distinctly heard you tell the former that the
latter would die at daybreak. I am afraid you
will find yourself mistaken in your prophecy.
By daybreak Fernandez should be well on his
way back to Equinata. There is one other
matter before I go. Here is the last money you
gave me." So saying, I threw upon the table
the roll of notes he had handed to me before I
left the island for Asturia.</p>

<p>A hideous scowl was the only response I
received.</p>

<p>Then, when I had placed my revolver in my
pocket, I made my way down the verandah in
the direction of Fernandez' prison. To my
delight I discovered that no change had taken
place there. The giant negro still lay where we
had placed him, while my own man stood sentry
before the door.</p>

<p>Bidding the Se&ntilde;orita and Matthews remain
concealed, I crept quietly forward. The plateau
was as silent as the grave, while the only light
to be seen was that which streamed from the
window of the room we had just left.</p>

<p>I had passed through some momentous moments
in the past six months, but I do not think that,
in the whole course of this extraordinary affair,
I experienced anything like the sensation that
took possession of me as I made my way towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the door of the hut. I had begun by taking
service under Silvestre; I had carried out his
instructions to the best of my ability; I had
found him a traitor, and now, here I was, throwing
him over and rendering assistance to the
other side. What was the end of it all to be?
Should I escape with Fernandez, or would
Silvestre catch us before we could reach the
boat?</p>

<p>Signing to the sailor to stand aside, I placed
the key in the lock. As I opened the door a
voice, which I instantly recognized, said as
calmly as though its owner were addressing me
in the President's study at La Gloria:</p>

<p>"So it's you, Trevelyan, is it? I had an idea
you'd come round to my way of thinking. I
heard your scuffle with the sentry. I suppose
you managed to overpower him?"</p>

<p>I answered him in a whisper that his conjecture
was correct.</p>

<p>"You must get up at once," I continued hurriedly.
"There is no time to spare. The Se&ntilde;orita
is waiting for you in the jungle, and I have a
schooner in the bay."</p>

<p>"But I can't get up," he replied. "Our worthy
friend, Silvestre, has taken good care of that."</p>

<p>"The deuce, he has!" said I. "What do
you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I am chained to the leg of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
bed," Fernandez returned. "Before you can
release me you must have the key of the
padlock."</p>

<p>In a flash I realized what a fool I had been.
It had never struck me, when searching Silvestre's
pockets, to find out whether he had any
other key in his possession. Now we were in
a pretty fix. It seemed as if I had defeated
Silvestre only to give him a very fair opportunity
of turning the tables upon me. At any
other time I should have sworn at the contrariness
of my luck; now, however, I had too much
upon my mind to have time to seek relief in that
direction. It was a problem that any man might
have been excused for feeling diffident about.
The Se&ntilde;orita was concealed in the scrub; the
lives of Matthews and his companions depended
upon my prompt and successful treatment of the
difficulty, and the only possible way I could see
of accomplishing that was to return to the room
in which I had left Silvestre, and, once there, to
overhaul him in the hopes of discovering the
all-important key. This time, however, the risk
would be increased a thousandfold. It was only
too probable that the old negress Palmyre, or
the half-caste Manuel, would have entered to
find their master in the lamentable condition I
had left him; in which case, for all the good I
could do, I might just as well take my revolver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
shoot myself and Fernandez, and so bring the
whole desperate affair to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure, I suppose," I remarked,
"that Silvestre has the key upon his person?"</p>

<p>"Quite," he answered. "He has been kind
enough to dangle it before my eyes every time
he has visited me. Only this afternoon he wittily
described it as the isthmus connecting the
continents of Equinata and Death!"</p>

<p>That was Fernandez all over. Even when my
heart was beating like a wheat-flail in my breast
with terror, and when every moment I expected
to see Silvestre make his appearance in the
doorway, he must have his joke.</p>

<p>"Well," I said at last, "I suppose there is
nothing for it but for me to return to the house
and to endeavour to obtain possession of the
key. Heaven alone knows whether I shall be
successful. In the meantime the Se&ntilde;orita had
better make her way down to the shore. You
will of course keep very quiet until I return."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon my doing that," he
replied. "You will find me here when you
return."</p>

<p>Without another word I left the hut and crept
round it to the spot where the Se&ntilde;orita and the
faithful Matthews were anxiously waiting for
me. So dark was it in the jungle that I could
see nothing of them, and it was not until I called<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to them that I could discover their whereabouts.
Then, drawing the lady a little on one side, I
hastened to explain the situation to her.</p>

<p>"You will find the key hanging round his
neck," she said in a fierce whisper. "If you
only knew what a miserable part it has played
in my life of late, you would easily understand
how familiar I am with its hiding-place."</p>

<p>I did not reply, but, turning to Matthews,
bade him escort the Se&ntilde;orita down the hillside to
the shore, where they were to await our coming.
When they departed I began my journey to the
house. The light still shone from Silvestre's
window, though the remainder of the building
was in complete darkness. Revolver in hand I
crept carefully along until I reached the steps
leading to the verandah. These I ascended, and
eventually reached the room in question. Every
creak of the boards brought my heart into my
mouth; and yet, if Silvestre had been discovered
and released by Manuel or Palmyre, why had
he not come in search of us? That he was no
coward I knew too well.</p>

<p>When I reached the open window I was able
to obtain a glimpse of the room. It may be
imagined with what delight I assured myself
that Silvestre was still there and, what was
more, lying just as I had left him. Softly I
crept in and approached him. I could fancy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
satisfaction he had felt when he had witnessed
my departure before without the key of the padlock
which fastened Fernandez' fetters to the
bed. From the way he glared at me, when
he became aware of my presence, it was
evident that he realized that I had come to
rectify my mistake. As quickly as I could do
it, and without wasting any words upon him, I
unfastened the collar of his shirt to discover,
suspended on a string round his neck, that tiny
talisman that, at that moment, was worth more
to me than anything else in the world. To take
possession of it was the work of a second, and
then I once more tiptoed towards the verandah.
I had barely reached it, however, when I heard
the door, communicating with the central passage
of the house open, and looking back I saw
Palmyre enter the room.</p>

<p>As I arrived at the end of the verandah I heard
a shrill scream, and as I heard it realized the
fact that, unless I could succeed in releasing
Fernandez within the next few minutes, all was
lost, and that I should, in all human probability,
never see old England again!</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">[Pg 254]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>To say that I made my way from the house to
the hut in which Fernandez was imprisoned with
as much speed as I could command, would be to
express my meaning very inadequately. As soon
as I realized the fact that the trick I had played
upon Silvestre was discovered, I threw prudence
to the winds, and ran as I had not done for
years across the plateau towards the building
in question. The sailor was still on guard at
the door, which was open, while the negro lay
bound just where we had thrown him down.</p>

<p>"Stand by, they're after us!" I cried, regardless
of who might hear.</p>

<p>With that I plunged headlong into the dark
hut, shouting to Fernandez as I did so to prepare
the padlock for the key. South American politics
produce some curious incidents, but I am
not sure that they could find another to equal
that which I am now so inadequately attempting
to describe.</p>

<p>Dropping on my knees beside the bed, I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
about for the chain and, running my hand along
it, at length obtained possession of the padlock,
inserted the key, and in a trice the President
was free.</p>

<p>"By this time they must have released Silvestre,"
I whispered. "For heaven's sake let us
get away from here!"</p>

<p>"Nobody could be more willing to do that than
myself," the other answered, springing from the
bed as he spoke, and coming in violent contact
with myself, whom he could not see. "You are
in command, so you had better lead the way."</p>

<p>Bidding him follow me, I hastened out of the
hut, ordered the sailor to accompany us, and
plunged into the jungle. As we did so a shout
from the house proclaimed the fact that Silvestre
was free once more and thirsting for vengeance.
We had not stumbled forward many paces before
other shouts followed, showing that he had called
Manuel and his gang to his assistance.</p>

<p>A very small percentage of the readers of my
story have, I trust, been called upon to run for
their lives through a West Indian jungle in the
dead of night. Those who have done so, however,
will be able to understand the sufferings of
the wretched trio who stumbled, reeled, scraped,
and fought their way down from the plateau to the
shore. The darkness was opaque, the obstacles
so multifarious, that never for a moment did we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
seem to have a yard's clear going. Take a sack,
a three-legged, and an obstacle race, throw in a
game of blind-man's buff, in which you are the
blind man, and you will have some faint idea of
our difficulties.</p>

<p>Once, from the hill behind us, the sound of a
shot reached us, though what its meaning was, I
could not even conjecture. At last, wearied to the
point of dropping, our faces streaming with perspiration,
our flesh cut and bruised, we emerged
from the forest and stood upon the seashore.
Unfortunately, in our haste, we had not steered
as true a course as we would have desired, and
instead of coming out in the centre of the little
bay where the schooner's boat had been ordered
to await us, we found ourselves at the end of the
small promontory which separated the bay from
that in which the settlement was situated. This
was unfortunate in more ways than one, but it
could not be helped. The worst part of it was
that we could not see the boat or the figures of
the Se&ntilde;orita or Matthews.</p>

<p>"Look! what is that?" cried the President
at last, pointing along the beach to the left. "Is
it a man?"</p>

<p>I have fairly good eyes, but I must confess
that I could see nothing that in any way
resembled a human figure in the direction he
indicated. He, however, seemed positive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
he was right; so, realizing that we could do no
good by remaining where we were, we hurried
along the beach without further loss of time.
We had not proceeded more than fifty yards,
however, when the crack of a rifle came from the
scrub on our left. If it were aimed at me, the
man who fired it was certainly a very fair marksman,
for the bullet whistled by within a few
inches of my head. It was plain that Silvestre,
or at least one of his myrmidons, were not very
far behind us. We were destined soon to be
convinced as to their numbers and also as to
their identity. For the sound of the shot had
scarcely died away before three men emerged
from the jungle, and Silvestre's voice called upon
us to throw up our arms, and then added that
unless we did so we should be shot down without
mercy. I could well believe this, and I also knew
the sort of mercy we should be likely to receive
should we allow ourselves to fall into his hands.
The fate he had arranged for Fernandez and his
niece would be nothing to the cruelty he would
practise upon us.</p>

<p>"<i>Nombre de Dios!</i>" cried the President,
"why haven't I a weapon of some sort!"</p>

<p>He was destined to have one somewhat sooner
than he imagined, for as he finished speaking
another rifle-shot rang out, and instantly my
revolver fell from my hand and I realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
I had been shot through the forearm. The
President coolly stooped and picked up the
weapon.</p>

<p>"Look, sir, look, there's the boat!" cried the
sailor a few seconds later.</p>

<p>Sure enough there it was, but unfortunately
a considerable distance ahead.</p>

<p>"There's nothing left but to run for it," I
cried. "Come on!"</p>

<p>With that we took to our heels and scurried
along the beach. Silvestre, as soon as he
became aware of our intentions, sent a volley
after us, doubtless meant as an inducement
to heave-to. We paid no attention, however.
Though we did not look round we knew that
they were after us; but we had a fair start,
and if only they did not manage to hit us,
there was the bare possibility of our reaching
the boat in time. Already I could see Matthews
standing knee-deep in the water in order to
keep the little craft afloat. He shouted to
encourage us. Then there came another shout
from our left, and three other figures ran down
between ourselves and the boat we were striving
so hard to reach. All three were armed, and in
the man in the middle, when he called upon us
to surrender, I recognized the blackguardly half-caste
Manuel. For the moment it looked as if
our case were hopeless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>It is at such moments that all the inventive
faculties in one's possession hasten to one's aid.
Had I been permitted half a day to think the
question out, I should probably never have hit
upon a plan half as promising as that which then
flashed through my mind. The men in front
were little more than a couple of dozen paces
away; Silvestre and his party were perhaps a
hundred yards behind, and were every moment
coming closer. The thought had scarcely occurred
to me before the crack of rifles sounded from
behind. Fortunately none of us were hit.</p>

<p>"Down! down!" I cried to my companions.
"Let them suppose that they have winged
us!"</p>

<p>As I spoke we all threw ourselves with one
accord upon our faces on the sand. As I expected,
the men in front immediately jumped
to the conclusion that we had been shot by their
friends behind. They accordingly rushed forward
to make sure of us. My ruse must have dawned
upon Fernandez, for, to this day, I am certain
that I heard a chuckle escape him. Almost at
the same moment Manuel ran up to us, his two
companions being only a few yards distant.</p>

<p>"Shoot them," I whispered; and as I spoke I
saw Fernandez roll over on his side and raise his
right arm. His revolver gave three vicious little
cracks, and one by one each man stopped, performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
a curious spin, and then fell forward on
the sand.</p>

<p>I don't know that I am a particularly imaginative
man. As a matter of fact my friends
have on several occasions informed me that I
am a somewhat prosaic individual. All I know
is that at that moment, though why I should
have done so, no one, least of all myself, will ever
be able to tell (for I have never participated in a
hunt in my life), I let out a wild "yoicks" and
sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"Make for the boat!" cried Fernandez.</p>

<p>Without a word I did as I was directed. The
boat was now only a matter of some fifty yards
ahead. How I covered this distance I shall
never be able to understand. All I do know
is that when I reached the spot where Matthews
was standing, I came an ignominious cropper
at the water's edge. The fact was I was done
for, wholly and completely done for. It may
seem an absurd statement to make, but I will
leave it to the charity of my readers to remember
that I had been through a great deal that night,
and also that a shattered arm does not add to
one's strength.</p>

<p>At that moment Fernandez rose to a moral
height, far above that I had expected to find in
him. Turning to Matthews, who, as I have said,
was standing knee-deep in the water, keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the boat afloat, he cried: "Hold the boat steady
while we get Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan in."</p>

<p>I was so far done for that he must have
thought I was dead; nevertheless, and although
Silvestre and his men were by this time little
more than thirty yards behind us, he did not
abandon me, but with the other man's assistance
picked me up, then waded with me into the
water and dropped me into the boat, where I lay
like a log. I heard Fernandez order Matthews
and the other man into the boat, and then
wondered what was going to happen next. I
saw the Se&ntilde;orita half rise from her seat in the
stern. She uttered a little cry. Then I heard a
swish of water alongside, as if the boat were
being turned round.</p>

<p>"Take care, Silvestre," cried Fernandez, "there's
Equinata at the end of my barrel, and a good deal
more beside."</p>

<p>What Silvestre said in reply I do not pretend
to know. All I can say is that I heard the sharp
crack of his revolver, followed by a laugh from
Fernandez, and a wild shriek that might have
been anything, but which told me nothing. A
moment later, and just as I was feeling as if
nothing in the world mattered to me, I was
conscious of some one saying: "Pull up, my
lads, we'll get away yet!" At the same instant
a soft hand touched my cheek, and a low voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
whispered: "May the saints be merciful to
you!" Then I lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When I recovered my senses I was lying off
the top of the main hatch of the schooner.
Fernandez was standing near me, but it was
impossible to see his face.</p>

<p>Lying on my back I could not tell what was
happening. I could, however, hear Monsieur
Maxime arranging sundry nautical details with
his crew, and with all his accustomed fluency.
The little man had accepted the position from
his own standpoint, which, as you may be sure,
was theatrical to a degree. As I have since
heard, he avers that, had it not been for his
influence and exertions at that momentous time,
the President of Equinata would never have
returned to his country at all. For this reason
he is looked upon as a hero in Martinique to
this day.</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised you are not dead, se&ntilde;or,"
said a very soft voice, and, on turning my head,
I found the Se&ntilde;orita seating herself beside
me.</p>

<p>It was some few minutes after dawn, and in
the dim light her face looked very wan and
haggard. Allowing for the wear and tear of
time and the exigencies of a most anxious and
untoward experience, she was dressed very much
the same as she had been when she left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
ball-room at La Gloria on the night on which
I had effected their capture. But the woman
in her extraordinary beauty was still the same.
She was certainly one female in a thousand, and
he would have been a curious individual who
could have shown himself insensible to her
fascinations. Then Fernandez turned his head,
saw her bending over me, and came over and
also seated himself beside me.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," he began, in a voice that was
full of kindliness, "I am not going to attempt
to thank you for all that you have done for me.
For the present it is sufficient for me to do
what I can to mitigate your sufferings. I won't
deny that there have been people who have
doubted my medical ability; I am about to
prove to you, however, that I am more capable
than they suppose."</p>

<p>So saying, he removed the wrappings from
my arm and commenced operations. The bullet,
it seemed, had shattered the bone, and was
fortunately now lying quite close to the surface.
To extract it was the work of a few painful
minutes, after which the limb was set and bound
up. That accomplished I was at liberty to rise
from the hatch.</p>

<p>All this time our behaviour towards each other
was as diffident as could well be imagined. For
once the President had dropped his cynicism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
while the Se&ntilde;orita regarded me with eyes that
overflowed with gratitude.</p>

<p>The island had long since disappeared below
the horizon, and now the little schooner was
cleaving her way through the water under the
influence of a capital breeze. Escorted by the
Se&ntilde;orita I made my way aft.</p>

<p>Monsieur Maxime himself was at the wheel,
presenting a curious figure as he hung upon the
spokes. I found a shady spot for the Se&ntilde;orita,
and then walked across to where the President
was standing before the taffrail.</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me everything," I said.
"How did you manage to effect our escape?
Remember, I know nothing of what occurred
after you placed me in the boat."</p>

<p>"There's not very much to tell," he answered.
"I might mention, however, that Silvestre and
the half-caste will give no further trouble."</p>

<p>"You shot Silvestre, then?"</p>

<p>"I did," he replied, "and I don't know
that I ever enjoyed doing anything so much.
It was a close thing between us. Look
here!"</p>

<p>He pointed to his left ear, on the lobe of
which was a small scar.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been much closer, could
it?" he remarked. "My luck, however, stood
by me as usual." Then in a lower and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
kindly tone, he added: "My luck and the luck
of Equinata!"</p>

<p>For a few moments we stood side by side
thinking our thoughts in silence. I recalled the
day when I had first seen the dead man in Rio,
and also that never-to-be-forgotten afternoon
on which he had made the proposal to me that
was destined to cost him his life on the
beach of an island in the Carribean Sea and to
return me to Equinata a wounded and ruined
man.</p>

<p>At last Fernandez turned to me and, placing
his hand upon my shoulder, looked me full and
fair in the face.</p>

<p>"Trevelyan&mdash;Helmsworth&mdash;Helmsworth&mdash;Trevelyan&mdash;whatever
your name may be, you
have put upon me a debt of gratitude I shall
never be able to repay. I must confess, however,
that I cannot quite understand what it was
that so suddenly made you change sides. I
offered you excellent terms on the beach on
the night that I fell into your hands, and I
repeated it on board the yacht. You were a
pillar of rectitude then. When, therefore, the
game had been played and your employer had won,
why did you so suddenly come to my rescue?
I think I know you well enough by this time
to feel sure that your conversion was due to no
mercenary motive."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may make your mind easy on that
score," I replied. "It was not a question of
money."</p>

<p>"Then will you tell me why you did it?
Silvestre, when his chance came, would doubtless
have proved himself an excellent patron,
of course providing it didn't suit his book to
put you out of the way!"</p>

<p>"That's exactly it," I replied. "You have
put the matter in a nutshell."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am dense enough not to be
able to grasp your meaning," he returned.</p>

<p>"You suggest that it might possibly have
suited his book to have put me out of the
way. Well, that is why I threw in my lot
with you. It would make rather a long story,
but I will endeavour to tell it to you as briefly
as I can. When I agreed with Silvestre in
England to effect your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused for a moment with a little
embarrassment. Fernandez' eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Shall we say <i>deportation</i>?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"To effect your deportation! I did so
upon his giving me his word of honour that
no harm should happen to you. I had no
objection to his keeping you a prisoner as long
as he pleased&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which he certainly did. Proceed!"</p>

<p>"I have already confessed to you that had I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
known you first I would not have undertaken
the work; but I was out of employment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The mail steamer <i>Pernambuco</i>&mdash;stormy interview
with the Board of Directors in London&mdash;meeting
with Silvestre in the garden of the
Inn at Falstead&mdash;five thousand pounds down&mdash;and
five thousand when I should be handed over
to him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed good-humouredly as he noticed
my almost overwhelming surprise.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, to rule a country like
Equinata one must possess a faculty for obtaining
information. Allow me to frankly admit that
I was conversant with Mr. Trevelyan's history
and of his acquaintance with ex-President
Silvestre, when he made his appearance in his
beautiful yacht in the harbour of La Gloria.
But in telling you this I am interrupting your
narrative. Pray proceed! You remarked, I
think, that you were out of employment."</p>

<p>"I was; and the money offered me by
Silvestre was too tempting to be refused. I
came, I saw you, and as you know, I conquered.
I handed you over to Silvestre, as I
had contracted to do, and once more secured
from him his promise that, with the exception of
imprisonment, no harm should befall you. It
was then agreed that I should leave the island
at once in the yacht for Cuba, <i>en route</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
England. The money promised me for the
work I had done was handed to me, and I left
Silvestre."</p>

<p>"But you could not have reached Cuba in
the time?"</p>

<p>"I did not attempt to do so. A certain
conversation I had with Captain Ferguson
changed all my plans."</p>

<p>"And the purport of that conversation?"</p>

<p>"It appears that Ferguson had by chance
overheard the half-caste, Manuel, discussing
with the negress, Palmyre, certain instructions
they had received from Silvestre. Immediately
the yacht returned from conveying me from
Cuba it would appear that Silvestre was to set
sail for Equinata, and as soon as he was out of
the way you and the Se&ntilde;orita were to be poisoned
by Palmyre."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! The cowardly scoundrel!"</p>

<p>For the first time since I had known Fernandez
I saw a look of fear pass over his face. It was
not until later that I learnt that assassination
by poisoning was the one thing in the world he
dreaded.</p>

<p>"Well," he went on when he had regained his
composure, "what happened after that?"</p>

<p>"I arranged with Ferguson that, instead of
taking me on to Cuba, he should drop me at
Asturia. I was fortunate enough to secure this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
schooner, and hurried back in her&mdash;in the
hope of effecting your release. The rest you
know!"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the rest I know!"</p>

<p>He turned away from me almost abruptly,
and stood for some moments looking down at
the bubbling water under the counter. When
he addressed me again it was in quite his old
manner.</p>

<p>"We live in an extraordinary world," he
remarked. "You plot to separate me from
my country and end by restoring me to it.
Silvestre agrees to make your fortune and
finished by placing you in a worse position
than you were before. Even the Se&ntilde;orita yonder
has found things turn out contrary to her
expectations. On the night of the now famous
ball at La Gloria, she was by no means satisfied,
so I was given to understand, with her
ball dress; yet that strange taskmaster, Force of
Circumstances, has decreed that she should wear
it, without intermission, longer than any festive
costume ever purchased?"</p>

<p>"And what of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Ah! My case is perhaps stranger still. I
began by looking upon you as my enemy and
end by finding you my staunchest friend. I
imagined that I had you in my power, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
few hours later found myself in yours. Silvestre
bought your services for ten thousand pounds&mdash;I
get them for nothing."</p>

<p>If ever there was a strange voyage it was that
one. The schooner herself was a very fair sea
boat; that, however, was about all that could
be said in her favour. It was her cabin accommodation
that proved most trying. After the
first attempt the Se&ntilde;orita declared emphatically
that nothing could induce her to sleep in it
again. Monsieur Maxime might say what he
pleased, she declared, but her mind was made
up. It was offered to the President, but he
declined. As for myself, I had already tried it
on the voyage from Asturia, and had no desire
to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>The living on board was but little better.
Monsieur Maxime was wont to declare that the
cook, Adolphe, was a past master of the culinary
art. In this statement, I fear, he somewhat
exaggerated; indeed, had I not laid in a stock
of provisions before setting out, I dare not think
how we should have fared.</p>

<p>On one occasion the Se&ntilde;orita had the temerity
to explore his galley. She emerged with a white
face and a settled determination to partake no
more of his <i>ragouts</i>, <i>bouillons</i>, etc.</p>

<p>"Really," she observed to me, "one scarcely
knows where to go on board this wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
vessel. The cabin is too terrible, and as for
that kitchen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She made an expressive gesture with her
hands as if to express her horror of the place
in question.</p>

<p>The same evening I was destined to have a
somewhat curious interview with the Se&ntilde;orita.
We had partaken of our evening meal, such as
it was, and had gone forward into the bows to
enjoy the cooler air there. It was a perfect
night, and surely no mortal man could have
desired a fairer companion than I had then.
We settled ourselves down comfortably, and,
having obtained her permission, I lit a cigar. I
do not know why I should have done so, but I
could not help feeling that I was booked for a
sentimental scene. Some men would doubtless
have welcomed it. For myself, however, I must
confess, that I dreaded it. The Se&ntilde;orita was
dangerous always, and never more so than when
inclined to be sentimental.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan," she began, when we had
been seated some minutes, and had talked of
the beauty of the evening, the freshness of the
breeze and a hundred different subjects, "you
of course know that there was a time when I
was your avowed enemy?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must say that I <i>do</i> know it,"
I answered, "and I should add that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
justified. No one could wonder at your distaste
for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that," she cried, with a
little protesting movement of her hands. "For
see how nobly you have behaved since. No,
do not interrupt me. I want to say what is in
my mind, for I know that I owe you an apology.
It was all my fault. I hoped to have won
you to our side." She paused for a moment.
"Unfortunately, I did not know that you were
already in love!"</p>

<p>"Then the information the President gave her
was not altogether complete," I said to myself.
And on thinking it over since I have often been
struck by the omission of this one, and probably
the most important factor in the whole
affair. For the fact cannot be denied that
had it not been for my love for Molly, and the
consequent desire to make money, I should, in all
probability, not have embarked upon the matter
at all.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I returned, "I fear I stand before
you in an altogether despicable light, so far as
my time in Equinata is concerned. The pitiful
part of the whole business is that, had it to be
gone over again, I should probably act as I
have done. However, I have shot my bolt, and,
though I managed to hit the bull's-eye, that is
to say, I succeeded in capturing the President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
I have failed to receive the prize. Let that be
my punishment."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't talk of punishment," she
cried. "You are mistaking my meaning. Do
you think that I am here to reproach you?
No, no, far from that! What I want to suggest
is that you should permit us to show our
gratitude. Had it not been for you Equinata
would never have seen General Fernandez again,
and I should not be here with you now. How
grateful the President is you can see for yourself.
Why should you not stay in Equinata?
It is destined to be a great country. There
are always opportunities for the man who can
seize them. You are that man. Why not try?
Would <i>my</i> help count for nothing?"</p>

<p>As she said this she drew a little closer to me.
The perfume of her hair was as intoxicating as
the finest wine.</p>

<p>"Think! think!" she continued. "Fernandez
cannot rule for ever. He might not last a year
even. Then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was so close to me that her lips almost
touched my face.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better be walking
aft?" I said. "Your <i>uncle</i> is probably
wondering where we are!"</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274">[Pg 274]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>Between ten and eleven o'clock on one
never-to-be-forgotten evening, the <i>La Belle
Josephine</i> sailed into the harbour of La Gloria,
and dropped her anchor a short distance from
the old coal hulk. Who that witnessed the
arrival of that tiny craft imagined the important
part she had played in the destiny of that small
but exceedingly excitable Republic? For my
part I know that as I stood on deck and watched
Monsieur Maxime take her in between the heads,
and scientifically bring her to her anchorage, I
found myself experiencing a series of emotions,
the like of which I have never before known.
The President stood on my right, the Se&ntilde;orita
on my left, and as we watched the twinkling
lights ashore, I fancy all three of us recalled the
eventful morning when we had said good-bye to
the town under such very different circumstances.
Our arrival had evidently been signalled from
the forts, for we had scarcely dropped our anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
before a hail from the bows announced the fact
that the harbour-master's boat was approaching.</p>

<p>Most men, I suppose, have at some time of
their lives a touch of the theatrical. For myself
at that moment I was distinctly desirous of
giving a dramatic turn to the situation. The
plot of my drama is an exciting one. The
President of the Republic is missing; the supposed
villain is believed to have abducted him.
Time goes by. A mysterious vessel enters the
harbour at the dead of night, when, to the
amazement of every one, the missing President
is found to be on board, and the man who has
saved him, and has brought him back to the
nation he loves so well, turns out to be the very
individual who is supposed to have wrought his
ruin. What situation could have been more
thrilling? I had already walked a short distance
along the deck, but as soon as I recognized in
the boat coming alongside the pompous little
official who had boarded the yacht with so much
ceremony on the occasion of my first appearance
in the country, I changed my mind, and hastened
back to the President!</p>

<p>"What does your Excellency desire?" I
inquired. "Would you prefer the news of your
return to reach the city at once, or would you
rather that it should be announced in the
morning?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is immaterial to me," he replied. Then
he added quickly, "No! No! On the contrary,
it is most material. There is a considerable
amount of business to be transacted first!"</p>

<p>I could guess what was passing in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow morning would certainly be
better," he continued reflectively.</p>

<p>"In that case," I replied, "it would be as
well for you to retire with the Se&ntilde;orita to the
cabin. From what I know of our friends who
are now coming aboard, the secret of your arrival
would not be a secret many minutes after they
got ashore."</p>

<p>"You are still in command, Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan,"
the President returned, with one of his short
laughs. "Permit me, Dolores, to escort you to
the saloon. I trust that you will not keep us
there longer than you can help."</p>

<p>"If you will permit me I shall join you there
myself as soon as I have given instructions
to Monsieur Maxime," I replied. "For several
reasons I have no desire to be recognized in
Equinata at present."</p>

<p>Having seen them depart to the miserable
little hole aft, I went forward to Monsieur
Maxime, and gave him his orders in a low voice.
After that I rejoined my friends. From what we
could hear of the conversation that followed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
port officials were in by no means good tempers,
and poor Maxime was roundly taken to task for
putting in an appearance at such an hour, for
giving them the trouble of boarding his vessel,
and, it would appear, for his remissness in having
no cases of infectious disease on board. After
about a quarter of an hour the officials departed
as they had come, that is to say, grumbling.
When the sound of their oars had died away we
left the cabin.</p>

<p>"Now the question to be decided is how to
get ashore without attracting attention," said
Fernandez. "If they recognize me in the streets,
the news will be all over the city by breakfast-time."</p>

<p>"Maxime must put us ashore further down
the bay," I replied. "If we are discovered we
shall then only run the risk of being taken for
smugglers."</p>

<p>I had heard Fernandez boast of the completeness
and efficiency of his coastguard service.
This was certainly a good opportunity of putting
it to the test.</p>

<p>Fernandez agreed to the arrangement, and, as
soon as all was quiet ashore, we began our preparations
for leaving the schooner. A boat was
lowered, and four of Monsieur Maxime's ebony
crew took their places in her. Then we bade
the owner good-night, ordered him to call at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
palace on the morrow for his reward, and in
our turn descended to the boat.</p>

<p>It was an exquisite night, and so still that we
could distinctly hear the ripple of the waves
upon the beach, more than half-a-mile away.
Carrying out the plan we had arranged we did
not make for the shore near the city, but steered
a course more to the south, in the direction of
the little fishing village where we had captured
the President. At last the boat's nose touched
the shore, and the men leapt out and pulled her
out of the water on to the beach. I landed,
and gave my hand to the Se&ntilde;orita, who sprang
nimbly ashore; the President followed.</p>

<p>"Welcome back to Equinata, your Excellency,"
I said, with a bow.</p>

<p>For once his composure deserted him. He
did not answer me, but turning his back upon
us, walked for a short distance along the beach.
When he rejoined us he was himself again.
In the meantime I had ordered the men to take
the boat back to the schooner, and had promised
them that a liberal reward should be sent them
in the morning. After that we took council
together as to how we should reach the city. It
would be impossible for the Se&ntilde;orita to walk so
far in the shoes she was then wearing; there was
also the risk of the President and Se&ntilde;orita being
recognized to be considered. We were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
discussing this momentous question when a noise
behind us attracted our attention. We immediately
turned to find three men hastening
towards us. They wore the uniform of the
Equinata Coastguard Service, and the individual
in the centre was plainly an officer.</p>

<p>"Confound them," I muttered to myself,
"they're smarter than I imagined. If I'm not
mistaken, this will upset our plans, and the
President's arrival will be known after all."</p>

<p>This was not the case, however. Their appearance
was destined to prove a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>"What brings you ashore, se&ntilde;ors, at such an
hour?" the officer inquired, addressing me.
"And what boat was it that landed you?"</p>

<p>I was about to invent some story, but the
President, with his customary quickness, had
grasped the situation, and was prepared to make
capital out of it.</p>

<p>"A word with you in private, se&ntilde;or," he said,
addressing the officer before him. "I fancy I
can satisfy you as to our honesty."</p>

<p>The other threw a glance at the Se&ntilde;orita,
bowed, and acquiesced. They walked a few
paces together, and though I could hear the
President's voice, I could not catch anything of
what he said. Their conversation lasted something
like five minutes, after which they rejoined
us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our friend here," said Fernandez, "quite
understands the situation, and has kindly offered
to arrange matters for us."</p>

<p>The officer bowed with ceremonious respect
to the Se&ntilde;orita. Then to me he said, with a
pomposity that was almost ludicrous&mdash;</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or, Equinata thanks you for the service
you have rendered her."</p>

<p>Then, having invited us to follow him, and
bidding his men continue their patrol, he led us
across the beach by a rough footpath to the high
road above.</p>

<p>"If your Excellency will do me the honour to
wait here," he said, "I will hasten to the house
of my friend, Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez Cardaja, and
obtain from him the loan of a carriage in which
to convey you to the palace."</p>

<p>"We will await your return," answered the
President. "I may, of course, rely upon your
impressing the necessity of silence upon Se&ntilde;or
Cardaja?"</p>

<p>"He will be as silent as the grave, Excellency,"
the other returned, and added somewhat inconsequently,
"we are old friends!"</p>

<p>Then, begging us to excuse him, he hastened
on his errand.</p>

<p>"I trust he will not be long obtaining the
carriage," said Fernandez, offering me a cigar,
and lighting one himself. "As I said a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
time ago, I have a large amount of business to
get through before daylight. Dolores, my dear,
I fancy you will not be sorry to exchange that
dress for another."</p>

<p>"If you knew how I hate it," she replied
passionately, "and yet&mdash;" she stopped suddenly,
and I fancied that she shivered. "Oh, how
glad I am to be back!"</p>

<p>A long silence fell upon us, which was eventually
broken by the sound of carriage-wheels.
A few moments later a lumbering vehicle made its
appearance round the side of the hill. To our
surprise it was driven by the lieutenant himself.
He explained that he had not brought his friend's
coachman, having regard to the desire for secrecy
expressed by the President. He would himself
drive us into the Capital, and return the carriage
to his friend afterwards. Then we took our places
in it and set off. During the journey the officer
informed us of all that had transpired in the
country during our absence. General Sagana, it
appeared, had assumed the office of President&mdash;much
against his will&mdash;while Herma&ntilde;os and his
band of patriots boldly announced the return
of Silvestre to power.</p>

<p>"Herma&ntilde;os and I must discuss the matter
together," said the President quietly, and I
fancied I could see the smile upon his face as he
said it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>In something under half-an-hour we reached
the palace. We descended from the vehicle
at a side door, thanked the lieutenant for the
services he had rendered us, and then watched
him drive off on his return journey. So far
matters had prospered excellently; but I am
prepared to admit that I did not quite see what
was going to happen next. Fernandez, however,
seemed to have made up his mind. Taking
a bunch of keys from his pocket, as calmly as if
he were only returning after a short stroll, he
approached the door and opened it. A small
gas-jet illumined the vestibule. We entered
and softly closed the door after us. From the
vestibule we passed into a narrow passage, which
in its turn communicated with the great hall and
the State apartments. Surely never had the
ruler of a country returned to his palace in a
more unostentatious fashion. We made our way
through the great glass doors into the magnificent
entrance hall, between the lines of statuary, and
finally entered the President's private study.
So far our presence in the house had not been
discovered. General Sagana, his wife and
daughters, their <i>aides-de-camp</i> and secretaries,
to say nothing of the household, were all in
bed and doubtless asleep.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the Gas Company, which, by the
way, my dear Trevelyan, is capitalized almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
exclusively by Englishmen, realizes what an
important part it is playing in the history of
Equinata," Fernandez remarked, as he applied
a match to one of the jets. "Now, if you have
no objection, we will proceed to business. It
would be a pity to disturb the family of Sagana;
they will know everything in due course.
Dolores, you may remember that there is an
excellent sofa in your boudoir. Permit me to
conduct you thither!"</p>

<p>Before replying she looked at me, and there
was something in her glance that I was at a
loss to understand. She was tired, draggled,
and altogether different to her real self, and,
strange to say, there was also a curious hunted
look in her eyes for which I could not account.
She seemed to be appealing to me, and yet I
was not conscious of any reason why she should
do so. However, she rose and went away with
the President, leaving me alone in the room.</p>

<p>It was a fine apartment, hung with the
portraits of many past Presidents. I looked from
one to the other, as if in the hope of gathering
information from them. But they only regarded
me with stony indifference, as if the fate of
Equinata was a thing in which they no longer
took any interest.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to express in words my
feelings at that moment. As a matter of fact, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
knew that I was between two fires. I had gone
out of my way to save Fernandez; at the same
time, unless I allowed him to reward me, which
I was determined not to do, I had lost all I
possessed (for I was resolved not to keep the
first five thousand pounds of Silvestre's money)
in the world. I must begin life over again, in
which case my marriage with Molly was as far
off as ever. I was aware of Fernandez' friendship,
so far as I was concerned, yet I knew him
well enough to feel sure that he would repay old
scores against Herma&ntilde;os and his other enemies.
That being so, could I stand by and let them be
punished, when, but for me, they would have
escaped scot-free. It was not a cheerful outlook
for any of us.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Fernandez returned.</p>

<p>"Now to business," he said. "Do me the
favour of seating yourself at that writing-table."</p>

<p>I did so, wondering, and he placed a sheet of
notepaper before me.</p>

<p>"I want you to write to Se&ntilde;or Herma&ntilde;os,
asking him to come to the palace with all haste.
Tell him that the rightful President has returned,
and at the same time request him to bring his
friends with him to welcome him!"</p>

<p>"One moment," I said. "Before I do that
I must know your intentions. I am going to
speak plainly, General Fernandez! You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
remember that I have already had experience of
the manner in which Presidents of Equinata deal
with their rivals."</p>

<p>He was not in the least put out by my
candour. On the contrary, he laughed good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," he said. "I am
not going to harm them. As a matter of fact I
intend making them very good friends&mdash;not for
to-day, but for all time. What assurance can I
give you?"</p>

<p>I could not see that there was any. What
was more, I could not see how my refusal to
write the letter could save Herma&ntilde;os, if Fernandez
were determined to be revenged on him. I
accordingly took up my pen and did as he requested.
When I had finished, he read the letter
carefully, possibly to make sure that I had not
said anything in it that might serve as a warning
to the conspirators. Would his ruse succeed?
Would Herma&ntilde;os fall into such a very simple
trap? The mere fact that Silvestre had not
written it himself would surely make him suspicious.
Fernandez, however, evidently thought
otherwise. When I had addressed the envelope
he placed the letter inside, and then,
begging me to excuse him once more, left the
room. When he returned a quarter of an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
later, he informed me that he had dispatched
the letter by a trustworthy messenger.</p>

<p>"You should have seen the worthy Antoine's
face when I woke him," he said. "He thought
he was looking at a ghost. In an hour or so our
friends should be here."</p>

<p>To while away the time of waiting we made a
raid upon the palace larder, carried the spoil we
obtained there to the smaller dining-room, where
presently the curious spectacle might have been
observed of a lady in a sadly-dilapidated ball-dress,
the President of the Republic of Equinata,
and your humble servant, demolishing cold
chicken with considerable gusto.</p>

<p>Our meal was barely finished before the door
opened and a little grey-haired man entered the
room. He was Antoine, the old major-domo of
the household, who had served more Presidents
than any other official in Equinata.</p>

<p>"Well, Antoine, what is it?" the President
inquired.</p>

<p>"They are coming, your Excellency," said the
little man.</p>

<p>"And they do not suspect?"</p>

<p>"No, Excellency," the other replied. "I told
Se&ntilde;or Herma&ntilde;os that if he desired to be the first
to welcome President Silvestre, he must make
haste."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excellent! Immediately they arrive, meet
them yourself, and conduct them to the small
audience chamber. I will receive them there!"</p>

<p>Half-an-hour or so later, and just as we had
finished our second bottle of champagne, Antoine
again made his appearance to inform us that
Herma&ntilde;os and his companions had arrived and
were awaiting an interview in the room above
mentioned. I saw Fernandez' mouth twitch
and then set firm; there was also an ominous
twinkle in his eyes as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come with me, my friend, and we will
interview them."</p>

<p>"You will remember the promise you have
given me?" I said, laying my hand upon his
arm.</p>

<p>"You will find that I shall keep it," he replied
curtly.</p>

<p>I followed him from the room along the hall
to a door on the right, at which Antoine was
waiting.</p>

<p>"Have my instructions concerning the guard
been obeyed?" he asked in a low voice before
he turned the handle.</p>

<p>"They have, Excellency," Antoine replied.</p>

<p>Then we passed into the room.</p>

<p>If I live to be a hundred I shall not forget the
scene that followed. Herma&ntilde;os was standing on
the opposite side of the room, and grouped about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
him were three men whom, to the best of my
knowledge, I had never seen before. It is possible
they might have been Herma&ntilde;os' assistants on
that memorable night when we had secured the
President, but as they then wore masks I cannot
speak on that point with any degree of certainty.</p>

<p>The light in the room was not particularly
good, and for a moment I thought that Herma&ntilde;os
did not realize who it was that entered the room.
Had he done so he would scarcely have taken
those two or three quick steps forward. When
he grasped the situation his surprise was overwhelming.</p>

<p>"Fernandez?" I heard him mutter, as if he
were thunderstruck.</p>

<p>His companions also seemed taken aback.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Herma&ntilde;os," said the President
genially, "and so we meet again. Gentlemen, I
am delighted to find you here to welcome me."</p>

<p>"We've been tricked," cried Herma&ntilde;os hoarsely.
Then fixing his eyes on me, he continued, "So
you've turned traitor, after all, se&ntilde;or? I congratulate
you on the facility with which you
change sides."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interposed the President, "but
I cannot permit you to insult my friend. I
owe more to Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan than I can say,
and when you have heard the story I have to
tell, I fancy you, and Equinata with you, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
regard his behaviour in the light that I do. But
before we say anything about that, let us endeavour
to come to an understanding of our
relative positions."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment to allow his audience
to appreciate his words.</p>

<p>Then he went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot forget that you, Herma&ntilde;os, are one
of the gentlemen to whom I owe my abduction.
The complicity of your companions I have yet to
discover. Now for such an offence what is the
punishment to be? My only desire is to be
just."</p>

<p>I felt really sorry for Herma&ntilde;os at that
moment. He was familiar with the form that
Fernandez' justice usually took.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my friend, why do you not
answer me?" said the President banteringly.
"You know how Silvestre would have acted
under similar circumstances. What am I to
do? Shall I call in the guard, have you
arrested, and shot at sunrise, or shall I let you
go free? You know my reputation, I think, and
surely even a President should live up to that?"</p>

<p>"We are in your power and cannot help ourselves,"
the unfortunate Herma&ntilde;os replied.</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid you cannot," the
President returned. "You should have thought
of that, however, before you took to kidnapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the head of your country. You were never a
man, Herma&ntilde;os, who could make up his mind!"</p>

<p>Once more the President paused, and looked
from one to the other of the wretched men
before him.</p>

<p>"Don't play with us," cried one of the others.
"If you have made up your mind to shoot us, do
so, but don't keep us in suspense."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, it was remiss of me," Fernandez
replied with dangerous politeness. "Antoine."</p>

<p>The door was opened immediately, and the
major-domo appeared.</p>

<p>"Call up the Guards," said the President.</p>

<p>Antoine disappeared, to return a few moments
later with the officer of the Guard and his
men.</p>

<p>"Take these gentlemen to the cartel," said
the President, "and stand guard over them until
daylight. I will send you word within an hour
as to what you are to do with them. In the
meantime I hold you responsible for their safety."</p>

<p>I was altogether unprepared for this move.
Was Fernandez about to break his promise to
me? It certainly looked very much like it. I
was on the point of expostulating, when the
door opened and the Se&ntilde;orita entered hurriedly.
She glanced from one to the other of us with a
frightened expression upon her face. Then she
turned to Fernandez.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" she asked,
holding out her hands to him as if in supplication.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my dear, but I think it would
be better if you leave us," the President replied.
"I shall be very happy to give you full particulars
later."</p>

<p>"No, no," she cried. "Se&ntilde;or Herma&ntilde;os, you
helped to bring this trouble upon us, and&mdash;ah!
I see it all. Why are you here at this hour, and
what is the meaning of the Guard?" Then
turning to the President she continued, "Oh,
sir, are we never to be free from this sort of
thing? Is it impossible for us all to be friends?"</p>

<p>"It certainly seems difficult," Fernandez
replied. "Thanks to Se&ntilde;or Herma&ntilde;os and his
friends, I have passed through an extremely
dangerous and unpleasant crisis. Had matters
gone as they intended they should do, by this
time I should have been in my grave. Fortune
favoured me, however, and now I have returned
to my own. Who can blame me if I repay
those who would have worked my ruin?"</p>

<p>Turning to the captain of the Guard, he bade
him remove his prisoners. On hearing this the
Se&ntilde;orita completely broke down. She fell on
her knees at the President's feet and implored
him to forgive. Whether it was a mere
matter of acting and had all been previously
arranged, as I am sometimes tempted to believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
or whether it was genuine, I am not in a position
to say. Whatever else it may have been, however,
it was at least effective. Then I saw my
opportunity and took advantage of it.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency must forgive me if I interfere,"
I said. "There seems one point, however,
that has escaped your attention. If Se&ntilde;or
Herma&ntilde;os and his companions are to be held
guilty for your abduction, it is only fit and proper
that I, who was the leading spirit in it, should
take my place with them. If they are to be
shot then I must share their fate."</p>

<p>My decision seemed to stagger them. He
looked from me to them and then back again.
Then he laughed outright, but I could not
help thinking that his merriment lacked
sincerity.</p>

<p>"You are certainly an extraordinary man, my
dear Trevelyan. You abduct me and then save
my life. You rejoice at being friends with me
again and then ask me to shoot you. It seems
to me, Herma&ntilde;os, that you are fortunate in your
advocates. The Se&ntilde;orita, to whom I can deny
nothing, pleads for you; Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, to
whom I owe my life, refuses to let you die unless
he dies too. I should be more than human to
resist!" Then, waving his hand to the captain
of the Guard, who had been watching us with a
puzzled expression upon his face, he continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
"Well, well, since it must be, let it be so!
You can leave us."</p>

<p>The captain retired with his men, and a somewhat
awkward silence fell upon us. There was
still a look of pleading upon the Se&ntilde;orita's face.
The President, however, seemed thoughtful. It
was evident that he had no desire to forego his
vengeance. He paced the room for a few minutes,
while we watched him with anxious faces. Heaven
alone knows what Herma&ntilde;os and his friends were
thinking of, but I know very well what I thought,
and I can assure you, my dear reader, I was far
from happy. At last he stopped, and, after a
momentary pause, faced Herma&ntilde;os.</p>

<p>"Herma&ntilde;os," he said, "you threw in your lot
with my enemies, and you could not blame me if
I made you answer for so doing. I certainly
intended to do so; but I suppose we are none
of us infallible, and with such pleading in your
favour, I have nothing left me but to surrender.
From this moment you are free. I give you
your lives, gentlemen! Is it possible, since
Silvestre is dead, for you to give me your
allegiance? Now, shall we shake hands, endeavour
to forget the past, and live only to
promote the happiness of the country, for which
we have risked so much?"</p>

<p>One by one they advanced and solemnly shook
Fernandez by the hand. Then, at a signal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the President, Antoine left the room, to appear
a moment later with a tray of glasses and two
bottles of champagne.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," cried Fernandez, holding his
glass aloft, "I give you the toast, 'Peace and
prosperity to the fair State of Equinata.'"</p>

<p>When they had departed, Fernandez turned to
me with a queer smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will trouble us again," he
said.</p>

<p>I did not reply! What I was thinking was
that I would have given something to have
heard their conversation as they crossed the
Square!</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">[Pg 295]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Strange to say, the populace of La Gloria did
not appear to trouble themselves very much, either
one way or the other, concerning their President's
re-appearance. The officials, however, were, as
behoved them, considerably more demonstrative.
They were well acquainted with Fernandez'
temper, and, like sagacious mortals, realized
that it would be wiser for them to allow him
to suppose that, whatever their own private
opinions might be, they desired no better leader
than himself. With Herma&ntilde;os, and his fellow-conspirators,
he was not likely, as he observed, to
have very much trouble. They professed to have
seen the error of their ways, and were as enthusiastic
in Fernandez' praise as they had hitherto
been in his detriment. As for my own part
in this singular business I allowed Fernandez
to tell the story in his own fashion. This he
did, to such good purpose that in a very short
time I found myself the hero of La Gloria, an
honour with which I could very well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
dispensed. Monsieur Maxime and his crew were
most liberally rewarded by the President, as were
Matthews and his fellow-sailor. They remained
in Equinata for a short time, but what became
of them later I cannot say.</p>

<p>"My dear Trevelyan," said Fernandez to me
one morning, "I really intend that we should
have a serious talk together. Now you know
that whenever I have broached the subject of
a recompense to you for the trouble you have
taken, you have invariably put me off with
some excuse or another, but I will be denied
no longer. Forgive me if I say I am well
acquainted with the state of your finances."</p>

<p>"It is not a fine prospect, is it?" I said, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"If you had stood by Silvestre and had left
me to my fate, you would have been a comparatively
rich man. And even if you did turn the
tables upon Silvestre, why were you so quixotic
as to hand him back the money?"</p>

<p>"I think you can guess," I answered. "If
you can't, I am afraid I must leave you to work
the problem out."</p>

<p>"And if you would not take <i>his</i> money, why
should you be equally particular in my case?
It is only fair that I should recompense you for
the inestimable service you have rendered me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that it is impossible," I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
for, as I have already said, I had long since made
up my mind upon this subject.</p>

<p>Fernandez endeavoured to press me, but I
remained adamant. Nothing he could do or say
would induce me to change my mind. I knew
that it was only by adhering to my resolution
that I could salve my conscience. I had still
sufficient money of my own left to pay for my
passage to England.</p>

<p>Important as the capital of Equinata may
appear in the eyes of its inhabitants, it is, nevertheless,
scarcely so prominent in the maritime
world as certain other places I could mention on
the South American coast. It was true I could
wait for the monthly mail-steamer which would
connect with a branch line at La Guayra, or I
might take one of the small trading-boats and
proceed along the coast until I could find a vessel
bound for Europe. But having had sufficient of
trading schooners in <i>La Belle Josephine</i> to last
me a lifetime, I eventually made up my mind to
await the coming of the mail-boat, which, if all
went well, would put in an appearance in a
fortnight's time.</p>

<p>During that fortnight I was permitted a further
opportunity of studying the character of the
Se&ntilde;orita under another aspect. Since her return
to La Gloria she seemed to have undergone a
complete change. Her temper was scarcely alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
for two days at a time. She was capricious,
wilful, easily made angry; then she would veer
round, and be tender, repentant and so anxious
to please, that it was impossible to be vexed with
her.</p>

<p>"The President will miss you very much when
you leave us," she said to me on the evening
before my departure, as we stood together on
the marble terrace overlooking the palace gardens.</p>

<p>It was a lovely night, and the air was filled
with the scent of the orange blossom. I do not
think my companion had ever looked more
beautiful than she did at that moment. Indeed
her beauty seemed to me to be almost unearthly.</p>

<p>"I fancy every one likes to feel that he or she
will be missed," I answered. "You may be sure
I shall often think of Equinata. Perhaps some
day I may be able to return."</p>

<p>"Who knows where we shall be then?" she
replied gloomily.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked in a tone of
surprise. "You will, of course, be here, leading
the Social Life of Equinata as you do now!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid that even now you do not realize
how quickly affairs change in South America,"
she replied. "Some one else may manage to
catch the Public Fancy, there will be a Revolution
and we shall go out of power&mdash;perhaps to our
graves!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_299" id="page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot believe that. In any case your
uncle would take care your safety is assured!"</p>

<p>She gave a little impatient tap with her foot
upon the stones.</p>

<p>"Of course he would protect me if he could,"
she answered, "but he might not be able to do
anything. Had you not come to our rescue on
that island, what use would his protection have
been to me? How do I know that we may not
be situated like that again? Oh, I am tired of
this life&mdash;tired&mdash;tired!"</p>

<p>Almost before I knew what had happened she
was leaning on the balustrading, sobbing as if
her heart would break. I was so taken by
surprise, that for a moment I did not know what
to say, or do, to comfort her. Then I went forward
and placed my hand gently upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," I said, "is there anything I can
do to help you?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered. "You can do
nothing! Leave me to my misery. Does it
matter to you, or to any one, what becomes of
me?"</p>

<p>"It must matter a good deal to your friends,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"Friends?" she cried, facing me once more
and speaking with a scorn impossible to describe.
"I have no friends. The women hate and fear
me, the men cringe to me because of my influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
with the President. Even he may grow tired of
me before long, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I allowed this speech to pass uncommented on.
At the same time I wished the President would
make his appearance and put an end to what was
becoming a rather dangerous <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>. When
she spoke again it was in a fierce whisper.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that night when we stood
together in the balcony of the Opera House, and
talked of ambition and of what a man might rise
to? Se&ntilde;or Trevelyan, I tell you this, if I loved
a man I could help him to rise to anything.
Do you hear me? To anything!"</p>

<p>There was only one way to treat the matter,
and before I answered her I knew perfectly well
what the result would be.</p>

<p>"Enviable man!" was all I said.</p>

<p>She drew herself up to her full height. Then,
turning on her heel, she made her way swiftly
towards the house. My silly compliment had
succeeded where expostulation or reserve would
have failed.</p>

<p>Next morning the mail-boat which was to carry
me away from Equinata made her appearance in
the harbour. She was to sail at midday, and
up to eleven o'clock I had seen nothing of the
Se&ntilde;orita. About ten minutes before I left the
palace, however, she made her appearance in the
President's study. Her face was somewhat paler<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
than usual, and though she endeavoured to lead me
to suppose that she had forgotten our conversation
on the previous evening, I could see that the
memory of it still weighed heavily upon her.
The President had declared his intention of
personally escorting me on board the steamer,
and at the last moment, not a little to my
surprise, the Se&ntilde;orita decided to accompany him.
We accordingly set off, and in due course reached
the vessel, a miserable packet of some six hundred
tons, whose captain, on hearing of our arrival,
hastened forward to receive his distinguished
guests. After he had paid his respects he offered
to show the Se&ntilde;orita the saloon, and thus gave
me a few minutes alone with the President.</p>

<p>"It is needless for me to say how sorry I am
that you are going," said the latter. "I wish I
could have persuaded you to stay with us. But
I suppose you know your own business best.
Remember this, however! Should you ever
need a friend, there is one in La Gloria to whom
you can always turn!"</p>

<p>I thanked him and promised that I would not
forget, and then the Se&ntilde;orita rejoined us. We
had only time to exchange a few words before
the whistle sounded for strangers to leave the
ship.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said the President, giving me his
hand. "Think sometimes of Equinata."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may be sure I shall do that," I answered,
with a glance at the white town ashore.</p>

<p>Then the Se&ntilde;orita in her turn held out her
little hand. I took it, and as I did so looked
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, and in a low voice
added:&mdash;"May the Saints protect you."</p>

<p>Then she followed the President to the gangway.
A quarter of an hour later we were steaming
between the Heads, and in half-an-hour La
Gloria was out of sight.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<p class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">[Pg 303]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>It was a cold and foggy day in November
when the steamer which I had boarded in Barbadoes
reached the Thames. I had been absent
from England more than four months, and the
veriest glutton for excitement could not have
desired more than had fallen to my lot.</p>

<p>Having bade my fellow-passengers good-bye,
I caught the first available train to town only to
discover, when I reached Fenchurch Street, that
I should have some considerable time to wait at
Waterloo before I could get on to Salisbury. I
accordingly cast about me for a way of employing
my time. This resolved itself in a decision to
call upon my old friend, Mr. Winzor, in order to
obtain from him the letter I had entrusted to his
charge. As I made my way along the crowded
streets I could not help contrasting them to
the sun-bathed thoroughfares of La Gloria. In
my mind's eye I could see again the happy-go-lucky
<i>caf&eacute;s</i> on the tree-shaded pavement, the
white houses with their green shutters; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
behind the city, the mountains towering up,
peak after peak, into the azure sky.</p>

<p>At last I turned into the street I remembered
so well, and approached the office of my old
friend. I ascended the steps and pushed open the
glass door. Somewhat to my surprise a strange
clerk accosted me. When I inquired for Mr.
Winzor, the surprised look upon the youth's face
told me that something unusual had happened.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that he is dead?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Dead?" I cried, in genuine consternation.
"Good heavens! you don't mean that!"</p>

<p>"He died more than six weeks ago," the
young man replied. "He had some papers to
sign in that room, and when his chief clerk
went in to get them he found the old gentleman
stone dead."</p>

<p>I was more distressed than I could say at this
news. The little lawyer had been a kindly
friend to me, and also to my mother.</p>

<p>Thanking the clerk for his information I left
the office and made my way to Waterloo. There
I took the train to Salisbury, and, on arrival
at the cathedral city, set out for Falstead.</p>

<p>At this last stage of my story I will not weary
you with a long description of my home coming.
Let it suffice that I at last reached the village
and found myself approaching the house of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
childhood. The tiny gate had scarcely closed
behind me when the front-door opened and my
mother hastened to greet me.</p>

<p>When we reached her little drawing-room I
questioned her concerning Molly.</p>

<p>"I expect her every moment," said my
mother.</p>

<p>As she spoke the click of the gate caused me
to go to the window with all speed.</p>

<p>Shall I describe what followed? Would it
interest you to know how Molly and I greeted
each other? I think not. I will inform you,
however, that I was more than repaid for all I
had been through by the way in which I was
received.</p>

<p>Later in the evening we went for a walk
together.</p>

<p>"Dick, dear," said my sweetheart, "you have
not told me how your venture prospered."</p>

<p>This was the question I had been dreading.</p>

<p>"It has not prospered at all," I said. "The
fact is, I have made nothing out of it. I am
ashamed to say so, but I am poorer than when I
left England four months ago."</p>

<p>To my surprise she received my information
with perfect equanimity.</p>

<p>"But I am afraid you don't understand what
it means to me, darling," I said. "And, before
we go any further, I am going to tell you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
whole story. Though it may make you think
differently of me, I feel that I should let you
know all."</p>

<p>I thereupon set to work and told her everything,
from the moment of my first meeting with
Silvestre on board the <i>Pernambuco</i> to my return
to Falstead that evening. I finished with the
information that there was still upwards of five
thousand pounds of Silvestre's money to my
credit in the Salisbury bank. I told her that
it was my intention not to keep a halfpenny of it,
but to send it anonymously to a London hospital.</p>

<p>"And I think you would be right, Dick," the
sweet girl answered. "Do not keep it. It would
only bring us bad luck. And now, what about
our marriage?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I fear, dear, we shall have to go on waiting,"
I said. "I must try and get another berth, but
whether or not I shall be able to do so Heaven
only knows."</p>

<p>"Dick, dear," she said, slipping her arm
through mine as she spoke, "I cannot keep the
secret from you any longer. I ought to have
told you before."</p>

<p>"And what is this wonderful secret?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"I doubt whether I look it, Dick, but I am a
very rich woman."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"A rich woman!" I cried incredulously.
"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>For the moment I thought she was joking,
but one glance at her face showed me that
she was serious.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," she answered. "I am
a very rich woman. When poor old Mr. Winzor
died he left me all his fortune&mdash;nearly forty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>I could scarcely contain my astonishment.</p>

<p>"Was it not good of him?" she continued.
"Forty thousand pounds at three per cent. is
twelve hundred pounds a year, is it not?"</p>

<p>Even then I was too much surprised by her
information to be able to realize the change
that had taken place in Molly's position.</p>

<p>"Are you not glad, dear?" she said at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I replied, "but I cannot quite
understand it yet. It seems too good to be
true."</p>

<p>"We shall be able to do so much with it," she
said, drawing closer to me and lifting her sweet
face to mine.</p>

<p>"I am luckier than I deserve to be," I
answered.</p>

<p>And doubtless, my dear reader, you will say
it was the truth.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Molly and I have been married five years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
We have a boy of three, and a baby girl who
promises to be the manager of her mother. We
lead a very quiet life in a house we have built
for ourselves on the outskirts of Falstead. There
is not a happier man in the world than I am, nor
has any man a sweeter wife. So far I have not
returned to Equinata. As a matter of fact I do
not suppose that I shall ever do so, for grievous
changes have occurred there. As all the world
is aware, Fernandez was assassinated while reviewing
his troops on the Grand Plaza, two
years after I left, while Sagana met with the
same untimely fate a year later. Immediately
on hearing the news I made inquiries as to the
whereabouts of the Se&ntilde;orita, only to hear that
she had fled the country and had entered a
convent in the neighbourhood of Rio.</p>

<p>Perhaps she is happier there!</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of the world of fiction is that
the yearly increasing supply of fresh romances, by both
new and established authors, has no effect on the unfailing
popularity of the recognised masterpieces. The demand for
attractive editions of these books has never been greater than
it is to-day, and it is to meet this want that the publishers are
issuing this new series. The volumes are well printed from
clear type on good paper, tastefully bound in a design that will
grace the bookshelf, and splendidly illustrated. In a word, for
value, it is the best and cheapest series that has ever been
placed on the market.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
